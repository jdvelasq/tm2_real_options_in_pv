AB to DATE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_SYSTEMS have been widely installed on homes in
   europe and all over the world.  in europe and in ITALY INVESTMENTS in
   DOMESTIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS (PV) were boosted by generous feed_in
   tariffs that made these INVESTMENTS extremely attractive for
   SMALL_PRIVATE_INVESTORS, such as homeowners.  it is commonly agreed that the
   greater the building ENERGY_EFFICIENCY, the greater the
   PROPERTY_MARKET_VALUE. it is of PARAMOUNT_IMPORTANCE to determine the value
   that PV_SYSTEMS may add to HOME_SALE_TRANSACTIONS. the aim of the paper is
   to investigate whether SMART_GRIDS (sgs) INNOVATION can increase
   MARKET_VALUES due to higher PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_FLEXIBILITY. sgs give
   de facto producers and consumers, the opportunity to be active in the
   ENERGY_MARKET and strategically decide their optimal PRODUCTION/consumption
   pattern.  in this paper, we provide a model based on the REAL_OPTION_THEORY
   to determine the value of this FLEXIBILITY and the related
   MARKET_VALUE_INCREASE. we model the HOMEOWNER_DECISION to invest in a
   SOLAR_HOME with a PV_PLANT and connect to an sg by comparison to the
   decision to invest in a SOLAR_HOME not connected to an sg.  we determine the
   PROPERTY_POTENTIAL_MARKET_VALUE_INCREASE due to the opportunity to perform
   ACTIVE_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT given by SMART_GRIDS and we compare this
   VALUE_INCREASE to the PV_PLANT_VALUE per se.  to capture the value of
   MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY we implement a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH. results of
   simulations, performed according to ZONAL_PRICES' trend and VOLATILITY in
   the north and south of ITALY, show that in the north and in the south, being
   connected to an SG_INCREASES by about 5_10% the PV_INVESTMENT's value and
   this QUOTA_INCREASES as ENERGY_SAVINGS and FLEXIBILITY_INCREASE. the greater
   the FLEXIBILITY, the greater the PROPERTY_MARKET_VALUE.  2019 the author(s),

AB PRIVATE_HOME_OWNERS are free to invest in ENERGY EFFICIENT_REFURBISHMENTS of
   their building at any time.  besides, they can INSTALL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS,
   HEAT_PUMPS and other EQUIPMENT at will.  although the consequences for
   DISTRIBUTION_GRIDS can be significant, most studies about the FUTURE supply
   task still utilize fixed ANNUAL_RATES of refurbishment and scenarios for the
   installation of distributed ENERGY_RESOURCES (der). while highly
   ECONOMICAL_INVESTMENTS are usually undertaken, a lot of UNCERTAINTY remains
   for PRIVATE_INVESTORS. in this study, the effect of SUCH_UNCERTAINTIES is
   modelled in terms of a highly FLEXIBLE_REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION that focuses
   on the option to defer an INVESTMENT. it is therefore assumed that the
   expected value of most INVESTMENTS is high while a SIGNIFICANT_AMOUNT of
   RISK has to be dealt with.  HISTORIC_DATA of refurbishment and
   MARKET_SITUATION is used to calibrate the model and to derive FUTURE_RATES
   of refurbishment for DIFFERENT_SUBSIDY_SCHEMES.  2016 ieee.

AB RISK_MANAGEMENT is crucial when committing INVESTMENTS in
   ELECTRICITY_MARKETS. INVESTMENT_PROJECTS for the generation of ELECTRICITY
   are capital_intensive, in LARGE_PART_IRREVERSIBLE and FUTURE_PERFORMANCE is
   subject to HIGH_UNCERTAINTY. fortunately, most POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS
   have STRATEGIC_FLEXIBILITY for handling UNCERTAINTY and for mitigating RISKS
   under UNFAVORABLE_SCENARIOS. modern corporate FINANCE recognizes
   REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS (ROA) as the CORRECT_WAY to VALUE_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS
   with these characteristics.  due to both, ENVIRONMENTAL_CONCERNS and
   escalation of FUEL_PRICES, ELECTRICITY_GENERATION from RENEWABLE_SOURCES has
   grown dramatically worldwide over the last decade.
   RENEWABLE_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS share many of the features mentioned.  as
   such, OPTION_VALUATION_METHODS should be applied to estimate the
   MONETARY_VALUE of FLEXIBILITY in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS. this work
   presents an APPROPRIATE_METHODOLOGY for assessing the ECONOMIC_VALUE of a
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANT under uncertainties.  ROA is applied to determine
   the value of delaying the INVESTMENT_DECISION while waiting for better
   MARKET_INFORMATION that would reduce ACQUISITION_COSTS due to progress in
   SOLAR_TECHNOLOGY. the FLEXIBILITY of relocating the SOLAR_FACILITY in the
   FUTURE upon the appearance of a more ATTRACTIVE_SITE in terms of COST,
   NETWORK_ACCESSIBILITY or REGULATORY_POLICIES is also valued.  the problem of
   OPTION_VALUATION is solved through STOCHASTIC_SIMULATION combined with
   RECURSIVE_APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING techniques.  the methodology
   developed might be used by investors for more efficient decision_making and
   by REGULATORY_AGENCIES for designing ADEQUATE_SUPPORT_POLICIES that

AB purpose: this STUDY_AIMS to evaluate a HYDROPONIC_FARM (through
   NUTRIENT_FILM_TECHNIQUE) while considering UNCERTAINTY, SUSTAINABILITY and
   the system's utility in the DOMINANT_DESERT_GEOGRAPHY. the idea of the
   HYDROPONIC_FARM is to allow individuals/businesses to grow plants.  given
   the GEOGRAPHICAL_CONDITION, the HYDROPONIC_SYSTEM may be useful in the
   GULF_CONTEXT and may lead to FOOD_SECURITY and SUSTAINABILITY. additionally,
   the UAE_GOVERNMENT has initiated several SUPPORT_SCHEMES that can be availed
   for investing in SUCH_BUSINESSES that can contribute to the nation's
   FOOD_SECURITY. DESIGN/methodology/approach: the HYDROPONIC_FARM is evaluated
   using the net PRESENT_VALUE and REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH. the authors studied
   five scenarios: 1. business as usual, 2. 50% SUBSIDY on INITIAL_INVESTMENT
   through khalifa FUNDING, 3. 4% premium, 4. SUBSIDY plus premium and 5.
   SOLAR_PANEL installation with bore well.  findings: as per the assumptions
   and DATA_USAGE, all the SCENARIOS_SHOWS a POSITIVE_NET PRESENT_VALUE (NPV);
   nevertheless, scenarios 4 and 5 report the significant highest net present
   and DELAY_VALUE. RESEARCH limitations/implications: this study has
   environmental, economic and SOCIAL_IMPLICATIONS. lower IMPORTS indirectly
   lead to lower CARBON_FOOTPRINTS. the LOCAL_PRODUCTION of FOOD_ENSURES higher
   EMPLOYABILITY in the sector and increase in LOCAL_CONSUMPTION. additionally,
   FRESH_FOOD_CONSUMPTION is directly associated to GOOD_HEALTH.
   PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS: SUPPORTIVE_POLICIES such as subsidies through
   khalifa FUNDING may accelerate the expansion of SUCH_PROJECTS through
   domestic and FOREIGN_INVESTMENTS. one of the IMPORTANT_TAKEAWAY from the
   study is to invest in the training of the WORKFORCE. SOCIAL_IMPLICATIONS:
   given the GEOGRAPHICAL_CONDITION, the uae usually depends on FOOD_IMPORTS.
   if the HYDROPONIC_FARMS become popular, the residents will have access to
   FRESH_VEGETABLES and fruits.  higher engagement in AGRICULTURE_ACTIVITIES
   also ensures a SIGNIFICANT_INCREASE in agriculture_related businesses and
   higher EMPLOYABILITY. originality/value: the study adds novelty to the
   literature because the effect of khalifa FUNDING and INVESTMENT_ANALYSIS on
   SOLAR (wells) has not been evaluated in any HYDROPONIC_STUDIES. we presented
   the results with TORNADO_GRAPHS using NPV_RISK and REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH in

AB in DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, particularly in RURAL_AREAS, LONG_PERIODS of
   POWER_OUTAGES are experienced as the ELECTRICITY_GRID is technically or
   economically unfeasible.  as SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) is the most potential
   and SUITABLE_SOURCE of RENEWABLE_ENERGY for these areas, this PAPER_ANALYZES
   the ECONOMIC_VIABILITY of its INTEGRATION in DIFFERENT_TYPES of
   RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS. applying REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH under UNCERTAINTY in
   ELECTRICITY_PRICES, this STUDY_COMPARES the attractiveness of adopting
   SOLAR_PV over continuing ELECTRICITY from the grid focusing on
   VARIOUS_INVESTMENT_PAYMENT_SCHEMES including (i) FULL_PAYMENT, (ii)
   distributed payment for 5 or 10 YEARS without a down payment, and (iii)
   distributed payment for 5 or 10 YEARS with 20% or 40% down payment.
   applying the model with the case of the PHILIPPINES, the results with the
   FULL_PAYMENT_STRATEGY obtain OPTION_VALUES of usd 6888 for building type_i,
   usd 15349 for building type_ii, usd 21204 for building type_iii, usd 27870
   for building type_iv, and usd 34251 for building type_v.  these
   OPTION_VALUES_INCREASE by 21.6% and 22.5% with distributed PAYMENT_SCHEME to
   a 5_or 10_year period and increase by 5% and 13% for distributed payment
   with 40% and 20% down payment.  these OPTION_VALUES decrease with
   INVESTMENTS at later periods.  contrary to the
   CONVENTIONAL_OPTION_VALUATION_RESULTS of an OPTIMAL_DECISION to wait, our
   findings show the otherwise as earlier INVESTMENT_REDUCES the RISK of
   OPPORTUNITY_LOSS from delaying the adoption of SOLAR_PV. among the
   PAYMENT_SCHEMES analyzed, the distribution of PV_SYSTEM_COST in a 10_year
   installment period without down PAYMENT_SHOWS to be the most
   OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY which may encourage lower_income and risk_averse
   consumers whose decision to adopt SOLAR_PV is affected by COST_BARRIERS,
   ECONOMIC_STATUS, and HOUSEHOLD_INCOME. the STUDY_SUGGESTS the GOVERNMENT,
   particularly in DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, to support the INTEGRATION of own_use
   SOLAR_PV in BUILDINGS through incentives and subsidies, as well as
   FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS to offer more AFFORDABLE_TERMS of payment that
   encourages low to MEDIUM_INCOME_HOUSEHOLDS to adopt SOLAR_PV. further, this
   will not only augment the ENERGY_DEFICIENCY in these countries but also
   support the GLOBAL_ASPIRATIONS of reducing GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS and its
   ADVERSE_EFFECTS through gradually shifting to RENEWABLE_SOURCES of ENERGY.

AB grid_scale ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS} (ess) have been widely recognized as a
   technically VIABLE_ALTERNATIVE to NETWORK_AUGMENTATION in integrating
   growing RENEWABLE_PENETRATION in DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS. however, it is
   challenging to determine efficient and well_timed INVESTMENT in the
   grid_scale ess, considering BATTERY_SCHEDULES and FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES.
   within this context, we develop a methodology that explicitly (i)
   INCORPORATES_ESS_SCHEDULES within MONTE_CARLO_POWER_FLOW_SIMULATIONS, and
   (ii) determine the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY using REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION
   (ROV). specifically, we develop a mixed INTEGER_QUADRATIC programming to
   determine the OPTIMAL_SIZE and schedules of a grid_scale ess in an
   AUSTRALIAN_DISTRIBUTION_NETWORK. the benefits from BATTERY_OPERATIONS to the
   network are quantitatively incorporated in the ROV to capture the value of
   MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, and hence the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY. driven by
   the declining BATTERY_COST, the results suggest to delay the INVESTMENT to a
   later year to maximize the INVESTMENT_VALUE.  2019 ieee.

AB the limitedness of the NONRENEWABLE_LOCAL_ENERGY_RESOURCES in israel, even
   in the background of the later GAS_FIELDS_FINDINGS, continues to force the
   state to devote VARIOUS_EFFORTS towards GREEN_ENERGY_DEVELOPMENT. these
   efforts include installations, both for the SOLAR and for WIND_ENERGY, thus
   improving the diversity of ENERGY_SOURCES. while the standard discounted
   CASH_FLOW (dcf) method using the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) criterion is
   extensively adopted to evaluate INVESTMENTS, the STANDARD_DCF_METHOD is
   inappropriate for the rapidly changing INVESTMENT_CLIMATE and for the
   MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY in INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. in RECENT_YEARS, the
   REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) technique has been widely applied in many
   studies for the VALUATION of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS. taking
   into account the ABOVE_BACKGROUND, we apply, in this study, the
   REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS_APPROACH for the VALUATION of WIND ENERGY_TURBINES and
   apply it to the analysis of WIND_ENERGY ECONOMIC_POTENTIAL in israel, which
   is the context of our work.  we hypothesize that due to nature of WIND
   ENERGY_PRODUCTION_UNCERTAINTIES, the ROA_METHOD is better than the
   alternative.  the novelty of this paper includes the following: REAL_WORLD
   WIND statistics of the MEROM_GOLAN_SITE in israel (velocity 3.73 m/s, with a
   STANDARD_DEVIATION of 2.03 m/s), a REALISTIC_POWER_GENERATION_ESTIMATION
   (POWER_GENERATION of 1205.84 kw with a STANDARD_DEVIATION of about 0.5% in
   ANNUAL_VALUE which is worth about 1.3 m$ per annum), and an ECONOMIC_MODEL
   to evaluate the PROFITABILITY of such a project.  we thus discuss the
   existing challenges of diversifying RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES in israel by
   adding WIND installations.  our motivation is to introduce a method which
   will allow investors and officials to take into ACCOUNT_UNCERTAINTIES when
   deciding in investing in SUCH_WIND_INSTALLATIONS. the outcomes of the paper,
   which are obtained using the method of WEIBULL_STATISTICS and the
   BLACKSCHOLES_ROA_TECHNIQUE, include the result that MARKET_PRICE_VOLATILITY
   adds to the uncertainties much more than any WIND fluctuations, provided
   that the analysis is integrated over a long enough time.  2021 by the

AB the IRISH_GOVERNMENT recently unveiled plans to have 70% of ELECTRICITY in

   little ELECTRICITY is generated by SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC in IRELAND. in this
   study, a REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK is applied to assess the
   ECONOMIC_FEASIBILITY of utility_scale SOLAR in IRELAND. initially,
   ELECTRICITY_PRICES are identified as the MAIN_SOURCE of UNCERTAINTY and the
   least SQUARE_MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is used to price the REAL_OPTION. the
   findings are that, in the absence of COMPREHENSIVE_POLICY_SUPPORT,
   large_scale INVESTMENT in SOLAR in IRELAND is not commercially viable and
   that, where the REAL_OPTION has value, the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY is to
   DEFER_INVESTMENT. SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS_SHOWS that the results are robust and
   the analysis allows investors to make an informed bid to the newly
   introduced RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY_SUPPORT_SCHEME (ress). when POLICY_SUPPORT
   is introduced, a LARGE_REAL_OPTION_VALUE is obtained, and
   UTILITY_SCALE_SOLAR_INVESTMENT is profitable.  the implications are that
   solar_specific policy supports may work better than policies that include
   all RENEWABLE_TECHNOLOGIES because the dominance of onshore WIND_ENERGY in

AB INVESTMENT in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES is one of the
   CLIMATE_MITIGATION_STRATEGIES that can significantly reduce
   GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS in the ENERGY_SECTOR. however, in
   DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, INVESTMENT is challenged by HIGH_CAPITAL_EXPENDITURES
   and several uncertainties.  this PAPER_AIMS to provide DECISION_SUPPORT for
   INVESTMENT in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_PROJECTS by evaluating the
   COMPARATIVE_ATTRACTIVENESS of shifting ENERGY_SOURCES from FOSSIL_FUELS to
   RENEWABLES and nuclear.  applying the REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH (ROA), this
   PAPER_CALCULATES the value of the FLEXIBILITY to postpone the
   INVESTMENT_DECISION and identifies the OPTIMAL_TIMING (described here as the
   TRIGGER_PRICE of COAL) for shifting to SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. then,
   VARIOUS_UNCERTAINTIES are considered, such as COAL and ELECTRICITY_PRICES,
   NEGATIVE_EXTERNALITY of using FOSSIL_FUELS, and the RISK of a
   NUCLEAR_ACCIDENT, which are modelled using GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION,
   POISSON_PROCESS, and BERNOULLI_PROBABILITY. applying the ROA_MODEL in the
   case of the PHILIPPINES, results find that investing in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY
   is a better option than continuing to use COAL for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION.
   however, contrary to CONVENTIONAL_OPTION_VALUATION_RESULT that waiting is a
   better strategy, this study found that delaying or postponing the
   INVESTMENT_DECISIONS may lead to POSSIBLE_OPPORTUNITY_LOSSES. among the
   AVAILABLE_SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES, geothermal is the most attractive with
   TRIGGER_PRICES of COAL equal to usd 49.95/ton, followed by nuclear (usd

AB in the ACTUAL_CONTEXT in which COMMERCIAL_INDUSTRIES_NEED to achieve greater
   competitiveness through their processes, efficiency is required in the
   MANAGEMENT of ELECTRICITY. COMMERCIAL_BUILDINGS_NEED_SOLUTIONS that are
   adequate to their environment and that would mean ECONOMIC_BENEFITS. given
   the case in which a commercial building self_generates ELECTRICITY from

AB in the last decade, PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) ENERGY has grown within the
   BRAZILIAN_ELECTRICITY_MATRIX and still presents a promising decarbonized
   alternative.  thus, the assessment of the viability of INVESTMENT in
   PV_PROJECTS in a DYNAMIC_MARKET and REGULATION_FRAMEWORK is necessary.  the
   STANDARD_APPROACHES to INVESTMENT_DECISION taking: net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV)
   of forecasted discounted cash flows (dcf) consider both the return and RISK
   of the project.  nonetheless, these approaches do not consider several
   uncertainties that may CONSTITUTE_RISK_FACTORS, such as the variability of
   SOLAR_IRRADIATION and the PENALTY_RULES imposed by the regulator.  in this
   paper, MONTHLY_DAILY_MEASUREMENTS of the SOLAR_RESOURCE were collected over
   five YEARS in the BRAZILIAN_STATE of rio de janeiro.  using this database,
   the STATISTICAL_DISTRIBUTION that best fits the variability of irradiance is
   determined.  a centralized PV_SOLAR_ENERGY_PROJECT is simulated under the
   TYPICAL_CHARACTERISTICS of auctions held since 2014 by the brazilian
   NATIONAL_AGENCY of ELECTRIC_ENERGY (aneel). MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is applied on
   the IRRADIATION_DATA and the RISK of the FINANCIAL_RETURN falling below a
   specified value is calculated, using a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to estimate the
   effect of ENERGY_OUTPUT_SHORTFALL. to the best of our knowledge, this is the
   first work contemplating FINANCIAL_RISK_QUANTIFICATION of
   centralized_generation auctions contracts using such an approach, which
   MIXES_MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION, expected shortfall and REAL_OPTIONS. it
   demonstrates how important it can be to CAPITAL_INVESTORS to correctly value
   the COMPOUND_EFFECT of IRRADIATION_VARIABILITY coupled with
   REGULATORY_RULES, and the FINANCIAL_RISK_EFFECT these issues might have on
   the PROJECT_VALUE of centralized_generation projects.  it can be clearly
   seen that the CORRESPONDING_NPV of the project is significantly reduced from
   almost 8 million r$ to less than 2 million r$, with capping RULES_PENALTIES,
   and to less than 0.6 million r$ in the case of OUTPUT_SHORTFALL. but more
   important is the RISK arising from non_compliance, or shortfall, with the
   guaranty contracted in the auction.  this penalty can cause up to 30% RISK
   of a NEGATIVE_NPV, or almost 0.36 million r$ expected shortfall or cvar,
   compared to no RISK or very SMALL_LOSS_RISK when without the effect of
   CONTRACT_PENALTIES.  2022, the author(s), under EXCLUSIVE_LICENCE to the

   invest or not, in a RESIDENTIAL_SCALE, grid_connected,
   SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM, aiming to obtain SAVINGS in their

   UPFRONT_COST but also accept UNCERTAIN_POTENTIAL_SAVINGS. if they do not
   invest, they forego any POTENTIAL_SAVINGS. to assess this
   IRREVERSIBLE_DECISION, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS is deployed to assess the
   ACTUAL_BENEFIT for the HOUSEHOLD. this approach allows us to determine
   whether to trigger the INVESTMENTS and the OPTIMAL_TIMING to do so.  our
   findings show it is optimal for our investor to invest in PHOTOVOLTAICS;
   however, some delay might be advised depending on the
   ENERGY_PRODUCTION_FACTOR of SPECIFIC_GEOGRAPHICAL_AREAS and the expected
   USEFUL_LIFE of the EQUIPMENT. the results of this study also show that it
   might be optimal to delay the INVESTMENT between 5.5 and 12 YEARS in some
   areas, which is a drawback.  our findings also show that subsidies and other
   incentives do not seem to be a KEY_DRIVER in the above_mentioned
   INVESTMENT_DECISION. this STUDY_CONTRIBUTES to the existing literature by

AB the SOLAR pv_based MICROGRID, as a NEW_MODE of PRODUCTION and consumption of
   CLEAN_ENERGY, backs up the variability of RENEWABLES and has
   IMPORTANT_IMPLICATIONS for mitigating GLOBAL_CLIMATE change.  however, its
   further development is limited because of the HIGH_COST and UNCERTAINTY,
   which discourages its OPERATORS_INVESTMENT_WILLINGNESS. to guide
   CAPITAL_INVESTMENT in MICROGRIDS, we construct a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL to
   investigate the FLEXIBLE_INVESTMENT of operators and the
   OPTIMAL_INCENTIVE_CONTRACT under UNCERTAINTY. the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD can
   more accurately measure the value of REAL_ASSETS in an

   and benefits.  moreover, a DEMONSTRATION_PROJECT in hefei, CHINA is provided

   COST_CHANGES on the INCENTIVE_CONTRACT. the results demonstrate that
   subsidies are still necessary to accelerate the development of SOLAR
   pv_based MICROGRIDS. however, subsidies in hefei can be stopped until the
   INVESTMENT_COST_DROPS to 6101.25 rmb/kw.  alleviating the COST_PRESSURE on
   operators can stimulate them to adopt the SOLAR pv_based MICROGRID, but

   for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT by using STOCHASTIC_PROCESS to
   describe the MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, co2price and INVESTMENT_COST. two
   indicators, i.e., PROJECT_VALUE and THRESHOLD_VALUE, are used to derive the

   solve the model.  the proposed model is used to empirically evaluate the
   OPTIMAL_LEVEL of SUBSIDY for SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA.
   the results show that CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme helps reduce SUBSIDY.
   unit generating capacity, MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, co2price and the
   VOLATILITY of INVESTMENT_COST are negatively related with SUBSIDY,
   WHEREAS_INVESTMENT_COST and the VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY_PRICE and co2price
   are positively related with SUBSIDY. it is suggested that

AB RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES are expected to play a MAJOR_ROLE in
   mitigating CLIMATE_CHANGE and RESOURCE_DEPLETION effects as well as in
   contributing to DOMESTIC_ENERGY_SECURITY. due to the INTERMITTENT_NATURE of
   SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV), there are often SIGNIFICANT_GAPS between
   ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and ENERGY supply by PV_PLANTS. this makes
   STORAGE_SYSTEMS a POTENTIAL_OPTION to MAXIMIZE_SAVINGS and
   ACCRUE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY by increasing the share of self_consumed
   ENERGY while guaranteeing ADEQUATE_POWER_LEVELS in DISTRIBUTION_GRIDS. this
   paper provides a THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK to MODEL_HOUSEHOLDS_DECISION to
   invest in DOMESTIC_PV_PLANTS coupled with BATTERY_STORAGE. to capture the
   value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY relative to the decision to install both a
   PV_PLANT and a battery, i.e., a domestic pv_battery system (pvb), we
   implement a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH and propose an OPTIMIZATION_MODEL, which
   we calibrate and test according to data from the ITALIAN_ENERGY_MARKET. our
   findings show that the option of storing ENERGY via BATTERIES_INCREASES de
   facto INVESTMENT_VALUE: the adoption of a
   PVB_INCREASES_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, as HOUSEHOLDS can optimally exercise
   the option to decide their consumption and STORAGE_PATTERNS_CONTINGENT on

   not paired with BATTERIES. there is indeed a POSITIVE_RELATIONSHIP between

AB background: the PHILIPPINES is making a SIGNIFICANT_STRIDE to become ENERGY
   independent by developing more SUSTAINABLE_SOURCES of ENERGY. however,
   INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY is challenged by COMPETITIVE_OIL_PRICES, very
   HIGH_INVESTMENT_COST for RENEWABLE_ENERGY, and
   HIGH_LOCAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICES. this PAPER_EVALUATES the attractiveness of
   investing in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES over continue using oil for
   ELECTRICITY_GENERATION. methods: this PAPER_USES the REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH
   to analyze how the timing of INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY depends on
   VOLATILITY of DIESEL_PRICE, ELECTRICITY_PRICE, and externality for using
   oil.  results: the result presents a POSITIVE_NET PRESENT_VALUE for
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT. under UNCERTAINTY in OIL_PRICES,
   DYNAMIC_OPTIMIZATION describes how waiting or delaying INVESTMENT in
   RENEWABLES_INCURS loses.  decreasing the LOCAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE and
   incorporating NEGATIVE_EXTERNALITY_FAVOR_INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY over
   continuing the use of oil for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION. conclusions:
   REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH_HIGHLIGHTS the FLEXIBILITY in the timing of making
   INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. at the CURRENT_ENERGY_REGIME in the PHILIPPINES,
   substituting RENEWABLE_ENERGY is a better option than continue importing oil
   for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION. policies should aim at supporting INVESTMENT in
   more SUSTAINABLE_SOURCES of ENERGY by imposing externality for using oil or
   decreasing the price of ELECTRICITY.  2018, the author(s).

AB SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT represents currently a VALID_REASON to support
   SUSTAINABLE_ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT. in fact, over the last few YEARS,
   governments have applied DIFFERENT_MEASURES to incentivize PRIVATE_CONSUMERS
   and firms to use RENEWABLE_ENERGIES. PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) projects are
   characterized by UNCERTAINTY due to METEOROLOGICAL_CONDITIONS, the
   UNPREDICTABLE_BEHAVIOR of GOVERNMENT, and MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY. since the
   net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) approach is not able to capture these
   UNCERTAIN_FACTORS, it was replaced with the REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH (ROA). the
   latter METHOD_MANAGES to embed FLEXIBILITY in PV_INVESTMENT using
   BINOMIAL_TREES. this PAPER_VALUATES_PV_INVESTMENT in all REGIONAL_AREAS in
   ITALY using an integrated approach between the discounted cash flows method
   and REAL_OPTION_VALUE, called expanded net PRESENT_VALUE (ENPV). we fit the
   PROBABILITY of TAX_BENEFITS into a BINOMIAL_LATTICE_MODEL after analyzing
   the GEOGRAPHICAL_POSITION and WEATHER_CONDITIONS of all REGIONAL_CAPITALS of
   ITALY. the results show that the cities with high irradiance/temperature
   have POSITIVE_NPV and HIGH_INVESTMENT_VALUES. on the other hand, while most
   cities have NEGATIVE_NPV, the inclusion of the FLEXIBILITY in
   INVESTMENT_DECISIONS gives ADDITIONAL_VALUE to the project, making the ENPV
   positive and implying an ATTRACTIVE_INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITY with the
   possibility of delaying the project.  we also propose a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS
   that shows how the REAL_OPTION_VALUE_CHANGES when INCENTIVE_POLICIES of the
   GOVERNMENT become more attractive.  this PAPER_CONTRIBUTES to the existing

AB PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_GENERATION has expanded its participation in BRAZIL and
   presents itself as a PROMISING_ALTERNATIVE as a way of meeting
   FUTURE_DEMAND. the STANDARD_APPROACHES to INVESTMENT_DECISION taking are the
   so_called net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) of cash flows forecasted over a
   TIME_HORIZON, and discounted at a risk_adjusted rate (dcf). although this
   APPROACH_CONSIDERS both the expected return and the RISK of the analyzed
   project, it overlooks several uncertainties involved that may
   CONSTITUTE_RISK_FACTORS for the project.  one of these is the variability of
   SOLAR_IRRADIATION over the YEARS as well as the PENALTY_RULES imposed by the
   REGULATORY_AGENCY. in this paper, MONTHLY_AVERAGE daily measurements of the
   SOLAR_RESOURCE were taken at a given location over five YEARS. the
   STATISTICAL_DISTRIBUTION that best fit the variability of irradiance over
   this period is determined, and MONTHLY_AVERAGES and STANDARD_DEVIATIONS of
   IRRADIATION are calculated.  a PHOTOVOLTAIC_SOLAR_ENERGY_PROJECT is
   simulated as participating in an auction organized by the brazilian
   NATIONAL_AGENCY of ELECTRIC_ENERGY (aneel) with TYPICAL_CHARACTERISTICS of
   auctions held since 2014 to the PRESENT_DATE for this GENERATION_SOURCE,
   with ENERGY destined to the regulated contracting environment.
   MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is applied on the IRRADIATION of the model, based on the
   determined STATISTICAL_DISTRIBUTION, and the RISK of the FINANCIAL_RETURN
   falling below a specified value is calculated, using a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH

AB in this paper we study a community or firm considering to diversify its
   INVESTMENT in two distinct RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, namely WIND and
   SOLAR_PV_ELECTRICITY. we assume TECHNOLOGICAL_LEARNING_CURVES as a function
   of CUMULATIVE_CAPITAL_INVESTMENT. a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH is applied as it
   takes into ACCOUNT_UNCERTAINTY about prices and learning, as well as
   IRREVERSIBILITY associated with INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. we investigate three
   DIFFERENT_CASES, dealing with UNCERTAINTY about FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES,
   and UNCERTAINTY about the speed with which learning drives the COSTS of WIND
   and SOLAR_ELECTRICITY down.  we assess the MINIMUM_THRESHOLD for the
   STOCHASTIC_PRICE and the MAXIMUM_ELECTRICITY_PRODUCTION_COST that makes it
   optimal for the firm to invest in the two technologies.  the results show
   that the LEARNING_RATE_AFFECTS the option to invest in but reducing
   CRITICAL_THRESHOLD for exercising it.  the greater the amount of CAPITAL
   invested, the more LEARNING_STIMULATES earlier exercising of the option to
   invest.  the firm will then anticipate the option to invest and exercise it
   for lower CRITICAL_THRESHOLD_VALUES if all CAPITAL is invested in one
   TECHNOLOGY. if CAPITAL_INVESTMENT is diversified, the option should be
   exercised at a higher CRITICAL_THRESHOLD. more UNCERTAINTY in ENERGY_PRICES
   or TECHNOLOGY_COSTS_POSTPONES the option to invest.  although investing in
   both SOLAR and WIND may be profitable under PARTICULAR_CONDITIONS of price
   and COST_UNCERTAINTY, the theoretically OPTIMAL_STRATEGY is generally
   investing in only one TECHNOLOGY, that is, SOLAR or WIND, depending on their
   RELATIVE_INITIAL_COSTS and LEARNING_RATES. this suggests that the practice
   in most countries of diversifying RENEWABLE_ENERGY may reflect a

   INVESTMENT_BEHAVIOR of developing a PV_PROJECT in the GOBI_DESERT
   considering MULTIPLE_UNCERTAIN_FACTORS. we take the ENVIRONMENTAL_COST of
   DESERTIFICATION_CONTROL into account for the first time in the literature.
   four other UNCERTAIN_FACTORS are THERMAL_POWER_COST,

   PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) analysis when dealing with UNCERTAINTY. our
   SIMULATION_RESULTS show that the GOVERNMENT could suffer a loss in
   accordance with the existing SUBSIDY_POLICY when investing in a PV_PROJECT.
   therefore, the SUBSIDY should be gradually reduced.  finally, the influence

AB MICROGRIDS can integrate the PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_PROCESS of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY and realize the SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT of POWER_SYSTEMS.
   however, it remains difficult to promote the WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION
   of PHOTOVOLTAIC_MICROGRIDS due to HIGH_COSTS. this study develops a
   REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for it to assess peak_valley ELECTRICITY_PRICES and
   ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES under the uncertainties in the
   INITIAL_INVESTMENT dynamic.  the ADJUSTMENT_MECHANISM is also established in
   the REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL to analyze the tendency of INCENTIVE_POLICIES
   changing with UNCERTAINTY. the results demonstrate that the
   OPTIMAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES of 31 provinces in CHINA_RANGE from 0.30
   rmb/kwh to 1.05 rmb/kwh, and the OPTIMAL_RATES of peak_valley price range
   from 3.09 to 6.32. on this basis, we conduct a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS of
   OPTIMAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY and peak_valley price rate and find that
   the threshold goes down significantly as the COST goes down.  however,
   RAPID_COST_VARIATIONS and fluctuations make DEVELOPERS_HESITATE to invest,
   which will seriously hinder the WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of
   PV_MICROGRIDS. this study extends the understanding of participants'
   strategies in a DYNAMIC_FRAMEWORK by analyzing the impacts of UNCERTAINTY on
   INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. we suggest developers pay attention to the changes in
   the MARKET and reduce INVESTMENT_RISKS by signing OPTION_CONTRACTS. a
   STABLE_INVESTMENT_MARKET_CORRESPONDS to smaller peak_valley price rates and
   less ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES. the policy_maker should provide flexible
   and EFFICIENT_INCENTIVES depending on the APPLICATION_SCENARIO. it is also
   suggested that in areas lacking SOLAR_RESOURCES, the GOVERNMENT should not
   only speed up the establishment of peak_valley ELECTRICITY_PRICES but also

   in the ECONOMIC_VALUATION of multi_stage projects, since considering only a

   then, the INVESTMENT_TIME_PROBLEM is formulated as a REAL_OPTION for each
   cluster to determine OPTIMAL_TIMING. although the two_step OPTIMIZATION
   approach can successfully close the loop between OPERATIONAL_DYNAMICS and
   INVESTMENT_DECISIONS, we are also interested in discovering patterns in a
   MULTIDIMENSIONAL_SPACE of INPUT_PARAMETERS that make a CERTAIN_COMBINATION
   of ASSETS_OPTIMAL among dozens of DISCRETE_CHOICES. on that note, by
   applying RECURSIVE_PARTITIONING ALGORITHM, DECISION_TREES are developed to
   estimate the structure of solutions rendered from OPTIMIZATION_MODELS by a
   rule_based system.  despite the HIGH_LEVEL of accuracy, the INITIAL_MODEL is
   biased in favor of highly FREQUENT_CLUSTERS, and discards the
   OPTIMAL_CLUSTERS resulted from EXTREME_MARKET_BEHAVIORS. value at RISK (var)
   is employed as a RISK_MEASURE to demonstrate the
   ENHANCEMENT_RISK_PERFORMANCE. finally, in order to investigate the
   robustness of the results, we conduct EXTENSIVE_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS over
   DIFFERENT_PARAMETER_SETTINGS. the proposed model can be thought of as a
   statistically OPTIMAL_SUMMARIZER of OPTIMIZATION_MODELS that enables
   DECISION_MAKERS to have an insight into OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES

AB PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS require LARGE_SWATHS of land that are currently being
   used for other purposes, such as farming.  one option for developing
   LARGE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS is converting FARMS that are currently
   economically unviable into COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. however, this
   may not always be an economically RATIONAL_DECISION as CROP_PRICES have the
   potential to increase over time.  fluctuations in FARM_INCOME due to changes
   in CROP_PRICES can alter the OPTIMAL_CHOICE of whether to continue farming
   or to convert FARMLAND into COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. this
   STUDY_ATTEMPTS to resolve this issue by proposing a REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK
   to VALUE_FARM_PRODUCTION when CROP_PRICES are uncertain.  by integrating
   UNCERTAINTY into the decision_making process, the value of keeping
   UNPROFITABLE_FARMS operating prior to developing the area into a
   COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM is assessed.  this helps DECISION_MAKERS
   understand the extent to which POTENTIAL_INCOME from developing a
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM should be greater than POTENTIAL_INCOME from farming
   when deciding on investing in a PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM. a CASE_STUDY is
   conducted to examine this framework and to calculate the net PRESENT_VALUE
   of a farm in SOUTH_KOREA. the results indicate that although the money lost
   from continuing to farm is substantial, farmers should DEFER_CONVERSION to a
   COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM until a SUFFICIENT_DROP in
   CROP_PRICES_OCCURS. when applying this strategy, the farmer can gain an
   additional 100% of expected revenue simply by deferring the
   DEVELOPMENT_DECISION until having better information on the MARKET_PRICES of
   CROPS.  2020 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB in this paper the FINANCIAL_VIABILITY of a NOVEL_STORAGE_CONCEPT, referred
   to as 'integrated pumped_heat_electricity storage', is assessed for both a
   coal_fired and a combined cycle (cc) POWER_PLANT located in GERMANY, as well
   as for a concentrated SOLAR_POWER (csp) plant located in spain.  the
   rationale of this concept is to use ELECTRICITY during times of
   CHEAP_WHOLESALE_MARKET_PRICES, e.g.  stemming from a high supply of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGIES, in order to GENERATE_THERMAL_ENERGY via a HEAT_PUMP,
   since THERMAL_ENERGY can be stored at comparatively low COST. if the
   ELECTRICITY_DEMAND_RISES again, the stored THERMAL_ENERGY is used to power a
   conventional water_steam cycle, thereby reducing the amount of FOSSIL_FUELS
   used or enlarging the operating time of a CSP_PLANT. a mixed
   INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAM, considering the day_ahead
   WHOLESALE_MARKET_ELECTRICITY_PRICES and remunerations of
   OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER in GERMANY, is employed to find an
   approximation of the OPTIMAL_SCHEDULE for the generation in the POWER_PLANT
   as well as for the purchase and the sale of ELECTRICITY. the
   FINANCIAL_VIABILITY is assessed using net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) and
   REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS. storing ELECTRICITY to profit from TEMPORAL_ARBITRAGE
   is found to be unprofitable, since the (conservatively estimated) COSTS of
   THERMAL_STORAGE_UNITS are still too high.  the largest part of the revenues
   stems from the remunerations of OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER. therefore,
   while the utilization of HEAT_PUMPS, which are estimated to have rather
   HIGH_COSTS, is not profitable, employing ELECTRIC_HEATERS without
   STORAGE_UNITS is found to be economically viable for a coal_fired and a
   CC_POWER_PLANT in GERMANY. here, NPV and REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS_YIELD the
   same result, i.e.  to invest immediately in such an application.  in spain,
   OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER is presently not remunerated, but only the
   call_offs of TERTIARY_CONTROL_ENERGY, which are not considered in the mixed
   INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAM. consequently, employing ELECTRIC_HEATERS in

   VRE_TECHNOLOGIES, the CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT is neglected in the CAPITAL

AB feed_in tariff (fit) is a broadly used POLICY_INSTRUMENT around the world,
   in which the PAYMENT_LEVEL is always designed to decline gradually in order
   to track and encourage TECHNOLOGICAL_IMPROVEMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY.
   however, the POTENTIAL_ADVERSE_EFFECTS of TARIFF_DEGRESSION on
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESEARCH and development (r&d) INVESTMENT have not been
   sufficiently addressed.  in this paper, we explore the impact of
   FIT_PAYMENT_DEGRESSION on RENEWABLE_ENERGY_R&D_INVESTMENT and analyze the
   EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE for r&D_INVESTMENT. we form a MODELING
   framework that captures the dynamics of FIT_PAYMENT_LEVELS and the
   inventor's STRATEGIC_REACTIONS to TARIFF_CHANGES. in this framework, we
   model the inventor's optimal r&D_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS based on the canonical
   REAL_OPTION_APPROACH and simulate the impact of FIT_PAYMENT_DEGRESSION on
   r&D_INVESTMENT and the EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE under
   DIFFERENT_R&D_CHARACTERISTICS using the case of the SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV)
   industry.  our results emphasize the ADVERSE_EFFECT of TARIFF_DEGRESSION on
   the COMMERCIAL_VALUE of NEW_RENEWABLE_TECHNOLOGY and hence the inventor's
   INCENTIVE in r&D_INVESTMENT, especially when facing more
   TECHNICAL_UNCERTAINTY and FINANCIAL_CONSTRAINTS. our model could help
   policymakers to DESIGN an EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE through which the
   COST of the FIT_PROGRAM is restricted to a MINIMUM_LEVEL but without

   fundamental and necessary to accelerate its development.  we consider the
   question of how to promote PV_INDUSTRY_DEVELOPMENT and which supporting
   policy is more efficient in accelerating adoption.  based on
   REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD, we establish a SUBSIDY_EFFICIENCY_MODEL for
   ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES and carbon_trading subsidies under two sources
   of UNCERTAINTY_POWER_DEMAND for PV and the INVESTMENT cost_reduction
   PROBABILITY. this STUDY_AIMS to compare the two forms of subsidies from the
   perspective of promoting IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT and maximizing the
   SUBSIDY_POLICY_EFFICIENCY for the GOVERNMENT (minimizing the unit
   carbon_mitigation COST) and advance RELEVANT_POLICY_PROPOSALS. an example of
   CHINA is provided to test the effectiveness of the model and to illustrate
   the implications of the solutions.  the results show that a carbon_trading
   SUBSIDY is better than an ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY and that it is essential
   to improve the demand for the power produced by the PV power_generation
   projects.  lower MARKET_RISK and driving TECHNOLOGY_PROGRESS are both
   conducive to improving the SUBSIDY_EFFICIENCY. this study also provides a

   because finding EFFICIENT_INVESTMENT_PLANS_INVOLVES_REASONING over
   VARIOUS_SOURCES of UNCERTAINTY and consideration of different sizing,
   location and TIMING_OPTIONS. this work proposes a NOVEL_FINANCIAL_FRAMEWORK
   using REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION (ROV) to solve the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PROBLEM
   for subsidizing RESIDENTIAL_BATTERY_INSTALLATIONS, considering
   COMPOUND_OPTIONS including the option to delay the INVESTMENT and its

   POWER_FLOW_ANALYSIS that INCORPORATES_BATTERY_SCHEDULING_PROFILES.
   specifically, the ROV_FRAMEWORK_SOLVES_STOCHASTIC_POWER_FLOW_ANALYSIS with
   BATTERY_SCHEDULING in a forward_looking MC_MODEL, and determines the
   OPTIMAL_PLAN for executing the options that maximize the INVESTMENT_VALUE
   using BACKWARD_INDUCTION over all MC_PATHS. however, this approach to mc
   becomes computationally prohibitive when BATTERY_OPERATIONAL_PROFILES are

   reduce MC_COMPUTATION_TIME by 95%. compared to STANDARD_FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS,
   the proposed model allows ROV to capture all uncertainties while allowing

AB many CORPORATIONS_INVEST in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) projects to
   MITIGATE_CLIMATE change.  however, lack of CAPITAL_POSES a GREAT_CHALLENGE
   to the development of the SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY. yieldcos that are a
   FINANCIAL_TOOL to SECURITIZE_ASSESTS for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CORPORATIONS were
   introduced to alleviate the FINANCIAL_PRESSURE, but their achievements are
   unable to meet the expected PERFORMANCE_LEVEL. therefore, a
   QUESTION_ARAISES: can yieldcos promote the development of SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY?
   to solve this issue, this paper utilized a REAL_OPTION_METHOD to investigate
   whether yieldcos can facilitate the deployment of SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS and
   their impact on decision_making processes.  based on the solution obtained
   from the REAL_OPTION_MODEL, we explore the impacts of DECISIVE_FACTORS on
   the DEFER_OPTION_VALUE, INVESTMENT_THRESHOLD and expected EXECUTION_TIME.
   the JOINT_IMPACTS of the DIVIDEND_RATIO and other factors are also
   investigated.  we conclude that yieldcos are suitable for SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS,
   while a HIGH_DIVIDEND_RATIO will make INVESTORS_POSTPONE their INVESTMENTS.
   in addition, by using the TECHNOLOGICAL_LEVEL to represent the DRIFT_TERM of
   INVESTMENT, we further discuss how decision_makers should react to the
   POTENTIAL_TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION. moreover, we also discuss the impacts of
   potential declines in feed_in tariffs on INVESTORS_BEHAVIOUR. we conclude
   that yieldcos can promote the development of SOLAR_PV in CHINA as it can
   URGE_INVESTORS to invest at an EARLY_STAGE. related POLICY_RECOMMENDATIONS

AB this STUDY_EVALUATES_INVESTMENT in a utility_scale SOLAR_POWER_PLANT using a

   been fully examined, especially within the context of the
   UNIQUE_SUBSIDY_PROGRAM of SOLAR RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES (srecs) in the
   usa.  using data from one of the most developed SOLAR_ELECTRICITY_MARKETS in

   and bounded SREC_PRICES in real_options VALUATION. our results show that
   deferring REAL_OPTIONS generates SIGNIFICANT_VALUE for the project that the
   TRADITIONAL_DISCOUNT_CASH_FLOW_APPROACH_IGNORES. it is thus optimal to
   postpone the INVESTMENT in more than 70% of cases.  in addition, we

AB the world has witnessed an increase in the level of INVESTMENTS for
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in the PAST_DECADE mainly owing to the
   pressure for mitigating GREENHOUSE_GAS (ghg) EMISSIONS, whilst addressing
   the issue of CLIMATE_CHANGE. according to RECENT_STATISTICS,
   GLOBAL_INVESTMENTS edged up by 2 % in 2019 to $301.7 billion, taking the
   value of CUMULATIVE_INVESTMENTS since 2004 to $3.5 trillion, which has been
   attributed to the falling COSTS of SOLAR and WIND technologies.  with the
   commissioning of ADDITIONAL_CAPACITIES from RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES each
   year, there is a growing need for managing the associated
   RISKS_AND_UNCERTAINTIES from the perspective of DIFFERENT_STAKEHOLDERS
   throughout the planning, development and OPERATIONAL_PHASES.
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES entail CONSIDERABLE_TECHNOLOGICAL and
   FINANCIAL_RISKS_EXPOSURE, depending on the location where the technologies
   are implemented, and thus needs to be managed using techniques that would
   provide both the quantification of RISKS and OPTIMAL_DECISIONS that lead to
   RISK MITIGATION. the objective of the proposed RESEARCH is to develop a
   PROBABILISTIC_FRAMEWORK which broadly includes: (a) statistical modelling of
   FINANCIAL_RISKS _ such as variability of revenue due to ELECTRICITY_PRICE,
   DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS, GENERATION_COSTS, or other MARKET_CONDITIONS; and (b)
   evaluating options that maximise the stakeholders utility/reward functions,
   or MINIMISE_RISKS, for a given TECHNOLOGY_MIX. this RESEARCH_DEMONSTRATES
   the implementation of BINOMIAL_LATTICE_MODEL in REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA)
   for the VALUATION of INVESTMENTS on diversified ENERGY_PORTFOLIOS. the
   framework is applied to analyse the impact of RISKS_AND_UNCERTAINTIES on
   CAPITAL budgeting decisions relating to PROJECT_SIZE (expand or contract);
   PROJECT_LIFE and timing (initiation, deferment or abandon); and

AB small and MEDIUM_SCALE_ENTERPRISES (smes) are integral to
   ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT. however, they face significant challenges within their
   operations, of which access to an AFFORDABLE_POWER supply is profound.
   self_generation options have the potential to curtail these challenges to an
   extent, but SMES_NEED to choose options that provide
   SIGNIFICANT_COST_SAVINGS. this study proposes a simulation_based
   REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL using SECONDARY_DATA to evaluate the
   COST_SAVINGS_POTENTIAL for smes in switching from CONVENTIONAL_POWER
   generating sources to RENEWABLE_ENERGY based on three MAIN_SCENARIOS: using
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY as a backup; a COMPLETE_TRANSITION to
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION; and a PARTIAL_TRANSITION to
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. the results show that using RENEWABLE_ENERGY as
   BACKUP_SOURCES of ENERGY does not provide SIGNIFICANT_COST_SAVINGS to the
   sme.  however, a complete or a PARTIAL_TRANSITION from conventional to
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES offers SUBSTANTIAL_COST_SAVINGS for the sme over
   the life of the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGY. smes must consider
   CAPACITY_FACTORS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, tariffs for
   CONVENTIONAL_POWER supply, SYSTEM_RELIABILITY of CONVENTIONAL_SYSTEMS, and
   the INVESTMENT_COSTS for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION as critical determining
   factors for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS. SUCCESSFUL_INTEGRATION of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY by smes also requires POLICY_SUPPORT towards educating smes
   on its importance and TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS. KEY_POLICY_INSIGHTS
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INTEGRATION can allow smes to make SUBSTANTIAL_SAVINGS in
   their POWER_CONSUMPTION_COSTS. smes must be mindful of an approach towards
   investing in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES so that it also maximises their
   gains in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INTEGRATION. GOVERNMENT_POLICY must focus on

AB STRATEGIC_VALUATION of efficient and well_timed NETWORK_INVESTMENTS under
   UNCERTAIN_ELECTRICITY_MARKET_ENVIRONMENT has become increasingly
   challenging, because there generally exist multiple interacting options in
   these INVESTMENTS, and failing to systematically consider these options can
   lead to decisions that undervalue the INVESTMENT. in our work, a
   REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION (ROV) framework is proposed to determine the
   OPTIMAL_STRATEGY for executing multiple interacting options within a
   DISTRIBUTION_NETWORK_INVESTMENT, to mitigate the RISK of FINANCIAL_LOSSES in
   the presence of FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES. to demonstrate the characteristics of
   the proposed framework, we determine the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY to economically
   justify the INVESTMENT in residential pv_battery systems for ADDITIONAL_GRID
   supply during PEAK_DEMAND_PERIODS. the options to defer, and then expand,
   are considered as multi_stage COMPOUND_OPTIONS, since the option to expand
   is a SUBSEQUENT_OPTION of the former.  these options are valued via the
   least SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO_METHOD, incorporating UNCERTAINTY over growing
   POWER_DEMAND, varying DIESEL_FUEL_PRICE, and the declining COST of
   pv_battery TECHNOLOGY as RANDOM_VARIABLES. finally, a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS
   is performed to demonstrate how the proposed FRAMEWORK_RESPONDS to
   UNCERTAIN_EVENTS. the proposed FRAMEWORK_SHOWS that executing the
   interacting options at the OPTIMAL_TIMING_INCREASES the INVESTMENT_VALUE.

AB the use of RENEWABLE_SOURCES, especially PHOTOVOLTAICS, has become a
   VIABLE_ALTERNATIVE as a supply of this VITAL_ELEMENT without destroying the

   to propose a methodology of economic/FINANCIAL_EVALUATION of
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_PROJECTS in COLOMBIA, through the application of the
   REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION, the above supported by a mixed method that combines
   the review of QUALITATIVE_INFORMATION or documentary in conjunction with a
   QUANTITATIVE_SAMPLE based on NUMERICAL_DATA and OFFICIAL_FIGURES, in order
   to address the issue with RIGOROUS_LIVELIHOODS. the results indicate that
   the PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY has a HIGH_POTENTIAL in the country, according to
   the REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION the TOTAL_INVESTMENT_COST of the installation and
   commissioning for a 5000 KW_PLANT would be $ 18,930,000 usd, taking
   advantage of 1825 h of work thus generating about 9,125,000 kw/h.  it is
   concluded that the ENERGY_MATRIX in COLOMBIA must be diversified, supported
   by a GOVERNMENT_MANAGEMENT that FACILITATES_ACCESS to CREDIT_LINES that
   leverage the INITIAL_INVESTMENT in CAPITAL, additionally, taking advantage
   of the GEOGRAPHICAL_CHARACTERISTICS of guajira, magdalena and the atlantic

AB ENERGY_PRICE_FLUCTUATIONS_POSE a SIGNIFICANT_RISK and UNCERTAINTY to
   FINANCIAL_INVESTMENTS for NEW_DEVELOPMENTS in CONVENTIONAL_POWER and
   FRESHWATER_COGENERATION_FACILITIES. this STUDY_ATTEMPTS to address the
   problem of making ROBUST_VALUATION for low_carbon ENERGY project INVESTMENTS
   subject to multi_dimensional PRICE_RISK, particularly looking at some
   KEY_RESEARCH_QUESTIONS: (a) how does the CORRELATION_STRUCTURE, or
   independence, between the PRICE_RISKS affect the PROJECT_VALUE; and (b) does
   adding FLEXIBILITY in INVESTMENT_ENHANCE or worsen the PROJECT_VALUATION,
   given (a). this study identified three PRICE_FACTORS with
   SIGNIFICANT_FLUCTUATIONS that impact CONVENTIONAL_POWER_GENERATION, namely:
   WHOLESALE_ELECTRICITY_SPOT_PRICE, NATURAL_GAS_SPOT_PRICE, and
   CO2_MARKET_PRICE. the PRICE_FACTORS were used to construct a
   MULTIDIMENSIONAL_RISK_MODEL and evaluate INVESTMENT_DECISIONS for
   COGENERATION_PROJECT_EXPANSION in the FUTURE based on a low_carbon
   ENERGY_MIX. to this end, five COGENERATION_CONFIGURATIONS using
   combined_cycle gas turbine (ccgt) integrated with SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV)
   and CARBON_CAPTURE_AND_STORAGE (ccs) technologies were assessed.  a combined
   PRICE_RISK was initially estimated by transforming the given PRICE_FACTORS
   representing MAXIMUM_COVARIANCE using PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT_ANALYSIS (pca).
   the trend and volatilities in the MAJOR_PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT_SCORES (the
   combined PRICE_RISK_INDICATOR) were modelled using the
   GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS, whose parameters were
   determined and then used to perform time_series SIMULATION and generate
   MULTIPLE_REALISATIONS of the PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT. a BACK_TRANSFORMATION was
   then applied to obtain the simulated values representing
   FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES in the PRICE_FACTORS. the effect of PRICE_RISK and
   uncertainties were subsequently evaluated using a recombining
   BINOMIAL_LATTICE_MODEL for REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA). there were
   FINANCIAL_GAINS when PV was mixed with conventional natural gas_fired
   TECHNOLOGY. INVESTMENT in COGENERATION_CONFIGURATIONS with (a) 25% PV share
   provided a 53% gain in the extended net PRESENT_VALUE (ENPV); and (b) 50% PV
   share provided a 124% ENPV gain when compared to the
   BASELINE_COGENERATION_SYSTEM with no PV_SHARES. the analyses demonstrate
   that PV_TECHNOLOGY is a better hedging option than ccs against
   FUTURE_MARKET_UNCERTAINTY and PRICE_VOLATILITY.  2023 by the authors.

AB CONVENTIONAL_METHODS used in PROJECT_EVALUATION have a STATIC_NATURE, which
   cause DECISION_MAKERS to examine INVESTMENT_PROJECTS within a NARROW_SCOPE.
   as an alternative, real_options theory allows DECISION_MAKERS to use the
   concepts of UNCERTAINTY and MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, which CLASSICAL_METHODS
   do not deal with, in valuing INVESTMENT_PROJECTS. carlsson and fullers fuzzy
   real_options theory has been a solution for situations where CASH_FLOW and
   COST_VARIABLES used in the model cannot be expressed by using
   CLASSICAL_NUMBERS but by using FUZZY_NUMBERS. the idea of using
   INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS in REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY can expand the
   NARROW_SCOPE more effectively than the idea of using classical real_options
   theory, thereby providing an opportunity to evaluate INVESTMENT_PROJECTS
   from a wider perspective.  in this study, INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY real_option
   VALUATION model has been developed and applied to the EVALUATION of
   SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS. studies have shown that
   SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS that do not seem profitable today in turkey can

AB FLEXIBLE_OPTIONS are expected to be adopted in CLIMATE_CHANGE
   MITIGATION_STRATEGIES due to the HIGH_UNCERTAINTY of CLIMATE_CHANGE.
   REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) matches the feature of filling FLEXIBILITY under
   CLIMATE_CHANGE but is seldom leveraged in the decision_making of
   STRATEGY_INVESTMENT at the building scale.  this study proposes a roa_based
   decision_making framework to bridge this RESEARCH_GAP. first, the
   FUTURE_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION is simulated, and the expected yearly
   FUTURE_ENERGY_LOSS caused by CLIMATE_CHANGE is calculated.  then, individual
   and SEQUENTIAL_INVESTMENT_ANALYSES are made based on ROA and three
   strategies (i.e., shading, PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS, and shading +
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS). finally, a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS for
   OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME, INVESTMENT_SEQUENCE, etc., is performed, and
   REGRESSION_ANALYSIS is used to prove and extend the
   SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS_RESULTS. the results show that CLIMATE_CHANGE
   UNCERTAINTY does not alter the optimal individual and
   SEQUENTIAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES. however, increasing the
   DISCOUNT_RATE_ADVANCES the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME and shows an
   EXPONENTIAL_RELATIONSHIP with the premium.  the enhancement of forcing has a
   MARGINAL_EFFECT on PROJECT_RETURN and it advances the
   OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_YEAR for INDIVIDUAL_INVESTMENT. additionally, the forcing
   positively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option under shared
   socioeconomic pathways ssp1_2.6 and ssp2_4.5 but it negatively correlates
   with the benefit of deferring the option under ssp3_7.0 and ssp5_8.5. the
   UNIT_DRY_BULB_TEMPERATURE under certain forcing yields a range of benefits
   from 0.47  106 to 0.90  106 usd when deferring the option.  this proposed

AB coal_fired POWER_PLAYS an IMPORTANT_ROLE in CHINA's power supply, even
   though the PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) power has developed rapidly in RECENT_YEARS.
   CARBON_CAPTURE_AND_STORAGE (ccs) TECHNOLOGY is essential for achieving
   anticipated long_term CLIMATE_CHANGE MITIGATION_TARGETS. however, CHINA's
   GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY policies tend to SUPPORT_PV, while incentives for ccs are
   few.  given this situation, a TRINOMIAL_TREE modeling_based
   REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH was developed to evaluate CCS_RETROFITTING_INVESTMENT
   in coal_fired POWER_PLANTS_VERSUS_PV_POWER_INVESTMENT. this model includes
   setting DIFFERENT_POLICY_SCENARIOS by considering
   ELECTRICITY_TARIFF_SUBSIDIES and CHINESE_EMISSION trading scheme (cn_ets).
   the results showed that coal_fired power with ccs has a COST_ADVANTAGE over
   PV_POWER in most provinces in CHINA, if the ELECTRICITY_TARIFF and other
   SUBSIDY_POLICIES remain the same; however, PV_POWER will be cheaper than
   coal_fired power with ccs in yunnan, tianjin, hebei, shanghai and
   SHANXI_PROVINCES in the ABOVE_CASES. incorporating ccs into cn_ets could cut
   the former'S_APPLICATION_COST, but the INCENTIVE_EFFECT of cn_ets is not
   obvious, because the CARBON_PRICE in CHINA is currently too cheap, and the
   INCENTIVE_EFFECT of a POWER_TARIFF_SUBSIDY (SUBSIDY at the
   PV_POWER_TARIFF_LEVEL) is much better for PV than for cn_ets.  increasing
   the LOAD_FACTOR is an IMPORTANT_WAY to reduce the CCS_APPLICATION_COST for
   POWER_PLANTS. the results of this study provide reference and guidance for

   OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIO_STRATEGIES implemented by
   ELECTRIC_POWER_ENTERPRISES by using REAL_OPTION and
   PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_METHODS. the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD is used to
   GENERATE_INVESTMENT_VALUES and their distribution.  these serve as the
   INPUT_VARIABLES of the PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_MODEL. the
   PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_MODEL is built based on the CONDITIONAL_VALUE at
   RISK. the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT is analyzed by considering four
   POLICY_SCENARIOS: different expected INVESTMENT_VALUES, the phase_out of
   subsidies, tightened CARBON_REDUCTION_STANDARDS, and
   DIFFERENT_INITIAL_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATE_PRICES. a CASE_STUDY is
   conducted to analyze the INVESTMENT_DECISION of an ELECTRIC_POWER_ENTERPRISE
   in CHINA. the results show the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIO_STRATEGY, the
   INVESTMENT_VALUE, and the CONDITIONAL_VALUE at RISK. the OPTIMAL_DECISION
   for ensuring a relatively high expected value while reducing RISKS is to
   increase the share of SOLAR_PV_POWER_GENERATION and WIND POWER_GENERATION in
   CURRENT_CONDITIONS. tightened CARBON_REDUCTION_STANDARDS and higher
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES_PRICES are conductive to increase the
   INVESTMENT_VALUE, reduce the RISK of loss and increase the share of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POWER_GENERATION. in contrast, the phase_out of the

AB purpose: the AUTHORS_FORMULATE_INDIAS_ENERGY_TARGETS in light of pushing for
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES and reducing the dependence on imported COAL. share
   of imported COAL in ELECTRICITY_GENERATION has been approximately 10 per
   cent in RECENT_YEARS. while INVESTMENTS in RENEWABLES have grown in
   RECENT_YEARS as seen in INSTALLED_CAPACITIES, coal_fired
   ELECTRICITY_GENERATION has grown because of rising demand for ELECTRICITY.
   the purpose of this study is to find a PLANNER_SOLUTION when
   HIGH_GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES_FORCE greater INVESTMENTS in RENEWABLE_ENERGIES.
   DESIGN/methodology/approach: the authors use REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH where
   GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES are the STOCHASTIC_VARIABLE. they present an
   OPTIMAL_STOPPING_PROBLEM and solving the PROBLEM_BACKWARD, the revenues from
   continuing with the CURRENT_ENERGY_GENERATION_MIX and those from replacing
   imported COAL with WIND_AND_SOLAR is compared for each period.  findings:
   the TRIGGER_PRICE for GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES when it is optimal for the
   SOCIAL_PLANNER to invest in ADDITIONAL_WIND and SOLAR_CAPACITIES is found.
   TRIGGER_PRICES is the threshold when INVESTMENT must be undertaken whatever
   be the FUTURE_EVOLUTION of COAL_PRICES; this gives the problem a value of
   waiting.  INDIA cannot afford to wait to invest if faced with strict
   short_term goals.  originality/value: the WORK_EVALUATES_INDIAS

AB taking FULL_ADVANTAGE of fiscal and ECONOMIC_INCENTIVES has become a
   COMPLEX_PROCESS for investors, who must find the RIGHT_PORTFOLIO or
   CAPITAL_STRUCTURE to obtain viable and COMPETITIVE_GENERATION_PROJECTS. in
   this context, this paper proposes a methodology for the optimal structuring
   of INVESTMENTS in non_conventional ENERGY_SOURCES (ncres) considering fiscal
   and ECONOMIC_INCENTIVES. three methods were evaluated: (1)
   LEVELIZED_COST_OF_ELECTRICITY (lcoe) combined with three
   METAHEURISTIC_TECHNIQUES; (2) discounted CASH_FLOW (dcf) with
   MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION and value at RISK (var); and (3) REAL_OPTIONS with
   black and scholes.  the proposed approach presents as the
   MAIN_FINANCIAL_INDICATOR the GENERATION_COST (gc), as well as three other
   FINANCIAL_INDICATORS, namely: net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV), value at RISK (var)
   and net PRESENT_VALUE for REAL_OPTIONS (NPV (formula presented.)). the
   propose approach allows for defining DIFFERENT_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIOS from
   where an investor can choose; each of which minimizes the gc.  furthermore,
   the methodology can be adapted to countries with DIFFERENT_POLICIES and
   FISCAL_INCENTIVES for the development of NCRES_PROJECTS. the results show
   that for each metaheuristic, an OPTIMAL_CAPITAL_STRUCTURE that MINIMIZES_GC
   is obtained; in this way, a gc of 0.032 (usd/kwh) is achieved for
   SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY, with a reduction of 49.2%, when
   TAX_INCENTIVES are considered.  2022 by the authors.

AB SOLAR_ENERGY_PROJECTS_CONTRIBUTE to SMART_CITY_GOALS by reducing pollution
   and assisting cities to become self_sustaining.  however, these projects,
   characterised by their SEQUENTIAL_NATURE, require a HUGE_AMOUNT of
   IRREVERSIBLE_INVESTMENT, especially in the case of large_scale
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS (mw). this aspect could make
   SOLAR_PROJECTS_UNATTRACTIVE for POTENTIAL_INVESTORS. to mitigate the RISKS
   of FINANCIAL_LOSSES the investor could invest in small_scale SOLAR_PROJECTS
   and switch to large_scale INVESTMENT_PROJECTS only if the MARKET_CONDITIONS
   are favourable.  this PAPER_AIMS to embed this MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY of
   changing INVESTMENT_SIZE during the PROJECT_LIFETIME into its VALUATION. to
   accomplish this, we use a COMPOUND_OPTIONS_APPROACH with a switch and call
   OPTIONS_MODELS to reliably price these projects by considering their
   riskiness and, their stochastic and multi_stage nature.  we also consider
   the determination of the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME like an AMERICAN_OPTION. we
   also propose a CASE_STUDY that shows that considering the

AB CARBON_DIOXIDE (co2) capture and storage (ccs) TECHNOLOGY and
   RENEWABLE_POWER are indispensable in CHINA's power sector to limit
   GLOBAL_WARMING to 2c.  because the two technologies have their OWN_MERITS
   and weaknesses, it is important to understand their INVESTMENT_BENEFITS and
   choose a cost_effective portfolio.  therefore, we conducted an
   INVESTMENT_EVALUATION of CCS_RETROFITTING of coal_fired POWER_PLANTS (cfpp)
   with HYPOTHETICAL_SUBSIDIES and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS (rpp) by
   using a REAL_OPTION_TRINOMIAL_TREE PRICING model and compared their
   ECONOMIC_BENEFITS in DIFFERENT_PROVINCES in CHINA. the results showed that
   when subsidies for the DESULFURIZATION_PRICE or the feed_in tariff of
   WIND_POWER were adopted, the CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp did not achieve the
   OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_VALUE, even in 2027. if the decarbonized
   ELECTRICITY_PRICE_INCREASES to 0.75 cny/kwh, equal to the feed_in tariff of
   SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC and BIOMASS_POWER, the CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp would be
   commercially viable, and their INVESTMENT_VALUE would exceed that of WIND
   POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS. in this situation, ningxia, xinjiang, and
   GANSU_PROVINCES would be most suitable for the development of
   CCS_RETROFITTING PILOT_PROJECTS; the advantages of the CCS_RETROFITTING of
   cfpp were not significant, WHEREAS_RPP was a better INVESTMENT_CHOICE in
   many provinces.  this paper provides a perspective on feed_in tariffs for
   POLICY_MAKERS to use in formulating a SUBSIDY_SYSTEM to support the
   development of ccs in CHINA, with POLICY_IMPLICATIONS for other countries.

   INDUSTRY_DEVELOPMENT in the EARLY_STAGE, and all parties in the society,
   including the GOVERNMENT and enterprises, have paid attention to and

   REGIONAL_INVESTMENT_BENEFITS and INVESTMENT_TIMING of CCS_RETROFITTING and
   rtdpv in DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS for each province in CHINA based on the
   REAL_OPTION_APPROACH. the results show that the INITIAL_COST_SUBSIDY and
   participation in the CARBON_MARKET are not as effective as the feed_in
   tariff SUBSIDY, and the INVESTMENT_RETURN of CCS_RETROFIT is better than
   rtdpv in the scenario with feed_in tariff SUBSIDY, and most provinces can
   achieve IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT. rtdpv without subsidies cannot achieve
   FULL_PARITY nationwide yet, and some provinces are not suitable for
   INVESTMENT without participating in the CARBON_MARKET. the net
   PRESENT_VALUE_APPROACH would underestimate the INVESTMENT_VALUE of ccs and
   rtdpv and prematurely REJECT_INVESTMENT in many scenarios, while provinces
   under the REAL_OPTION_APPROACH tend to DELAY_INVESTMENT to obtain

AB this PAPER_APPLIES the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD to analyse the DEFER_OPTION_VALUE
   and OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING for SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS in CHINA. the
   MAIN_PURPOSE of this paper is to examine INVESTMENT_BEHAVIOURS under
   DIFFERENT_MARKET_SYSTEMS and SUPPORT_SCHEMES. this paper further
   investigates the interaction of TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and SUPPORT_SCHEMES.
   four scenarios are designed, and the CORRESPONDING_REAL_OPTIONS_MODELS are
   established.  in the CASE_STUDY, we find that
   ELECTRICITY_MARKET_REFORM_ENHANCES the DEFER_OPTION_VALUE in the SHORT_TERM
   but makes the owners of SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS_POSTPONE their INVESTMENT.
   nevertheless, the GOVERNMENT can STIMULATE_INVESTMENT by implementing
   APPROPRIATE_SUPPORT_SCHEMES. additionally, the impacts of
   DIFFERENT_SUPPORT_SCHEMES vary according to the MARKET_SYSTEM. the impacts
   of feed_in tariffs and PRICE_PREMIUMS are similar in a regulated MARKET but
   are different in a FREE_MARKET. the PRICE_PREMIUM_SCHEME greatly promotes
   the DEFER_OPTION_VALUES in the SHORT_TERM, but the feed_in tariff scheme
   excels in the LONG_TERM. a feed_in tariff has a greater impact on reducing
   the expected EXECUTION_TIME and its variance than the PRICE_PREMIUM. in
   addition, more ATTRACTIVE_SUPPORT_SCHEMES are required when the
   TECHNOLOGICAL_LEVEL is improved.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB this PAPER_AIMS to analyze what happens with RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POWER_PLANTS,
   such as onshore WIND, PHOTOVOLTAICS and biomass, when the
   PUBLIC_POLICY_SUPPORT based on the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_LAW expires.  with its
   expiration, the first RENEWABLE_ENERGY (and especially onshore WIND)
   POWER_PLANTS will have to be scrutinized as to whether they can economically
   continue operation, whether they have to be repowered, or whether they need
   to be decommissioned.  the RELATIVE_MERITS of these three alternatives are
   evaluated by applying REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS. in contrast to
   TRADITIONAL_PROJECT_EVALUATION_TECHNIQUES, the REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH takes
   advantage of the use of UNCERTAIN_PARAMETERS included in the model, such as
   the development of the ELECTRICITY_PRICE or ELECTRICITY_OUTPUT. the results
   obtained suggest that parameters such as the level of FUTURE_OPERATION and
   MAINTENANCE_COSTS, the expected development of the ELECTRICITY_PRICE at the
   SPOT_MARKET, and the interrelations between these, as well as the
   development of the ELECTRICITY_OUTPUT from RENEWABLES can significantly
   affect the PROFITABILITY of these POWER_PLANTS and thus impact the decision
   about their further OPTIMAL_OPERATION.  2019 by the authors.

AB large_scale development of distributed GENERATION_POWER_PLANTS has given
   rise to NEW_CRITICAL_PROBLEMS for the DESIGN and MANAGEMENT of
   ENERGY_SYSTEMS and ELECTRIC_GRIDS. it is commonly agreed that
   CONTINGENT_PROBLEMS affecting LOCAL_GRIDS (e.g.  inefficiency,
   CONGESTION_RENTS, POWER_OUTAGES, etc.) may be solved by implementing smarter
   ELECTRIC_GRIDS. SMART_GRIDS give producers and consumers, the opportunity to
   be active in the MARKET and decide their optimal PRODUCTION/consumption
   patterns strategically.  this paper provides a THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK
   MODELING prosumers' decision to invest in PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS,
   assuming that they are integrated in SMART_GRIDS. to capture the value of
   MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH is implemented.  the model
   was calibrated and tested with data from the ITALIAN_ENERGY_MARKET. our
   findings show that the possibility of selling ENERGY via the
   SMART_GRID_INCREASES_INVESTMENT_VALUES. the connection to
   SMART_GRIDS_INCREASES_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY: prosumers can optimally
   exercise the option to decide the PROSUMPTION_QUOTA and switch from

AB CHINA's PHOTOVOLTAIC POVERTY_ALLEVIATION power stations (ppaps) properly
   combine POVERTY_ALLEVIATION and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION while also
   meeting RURAL_ENERGY_DEMANDS. the FUNDAMENTAL_PROBLEM is how to optimize the
   benefits of ppaps during its limited lifetime.  using the post_operation of
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_POVERTY_ALLEVIATION_POWER_PLANTS as a starting point, this
   paper proposes a model combining REAL_OPTION_THEORY and COOPERATIVE_GAME to
   determine the IDEAL_CONTRACT_PERIOD of service committed by the GOVERNMENT
   to the operation and maintenance (o&m) company, thus providing a reference
   for both parties.  the model's validity and applicability are verified by
   incorporating a ppaps from HENAN_PROVINCE in CHINA as an example;
   ultimately, the factors influencing the o&M_CONTRACT_PERIOD are ranked using
   the sobol GLOBAL_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS. the results show that when the SOLAR
   industry's environment is positive, the GOVERNMENT is more inclined to sign
   long_term contracts with o&M_COMPANIES. in contrast, the more the GOVERNMENT
   invests in the facilities, the more likely both parties will sign short_term
   contracts.  furthermore, the o&m company's CAPITAL_INVESTMENT in the
   POWER_STATION has a DIRECT_IMPACT on the CONTRACT_PERIOD. finally,
   CORRESPONDING_POLICY_RECOMMENDATIONS are proposed for FUTURE_O&M_CONTRACTS.

   expanding the INVESTMENT and INCENTIVE_INTENSITY for ess is conducted.  the
   results show that the ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY is more favorable for
   investing in the pv_ess project.  the INVESTMENT will be brought forward 2
   YEARS compared to the situation without INCENTIVE_POLICY. in addition, from
   the perspective of SOCIAL_WELFARE, the effects of the combinations of three
   ESS_INCENTIVE_POLICIES are better than any single ESS_POLICY, and the

AB MEETING_ELECTRICITY_DEMAND with RENEWABLE_GENERATION requires spending
   trillions of dollars in INVESTMENTS exposed to FINANCIAL_RISK.
   RENEWABLE_PROJECTS have MULTIPLE_STRATEGIC_REAL_OPTIONS to
   MANAGE_INVESTMENT_RISK, but they are usually priced separately in isolation.
   this paper proposes a framework for valuing MULTISTAGE_DECISIONS in a
   grid_scale PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_PLANT under UNCERTAINTY. the project is
   modelled as a COMPOUND_PORTFOLIO of AMERICAN_SEQUENTIAL and mutually
   EXCLUSIVE_OPTIONS to defer, expand and relocate.  the COMPOUND_OPTIONS are
   jointly priced by a hierarchically nested least_squares MONTE_CARLO
   ALGORITHM. the FRAMEWORK_INCORPORATES_UNCERTAINTIES related to decreasing
   COSTS in SOLAR_TECHNOLOGY and the EMERGENCE of more
   PROFITABLE_RENEWABLE_TARIFFS elsewhere.  the results show that the value of
   the COMPOUND_OPTION_PORTFOLIO significantly exceeds the value of the single
   DEFERRAL_OPTION commonly considered in practice.  ignoring expansion and
   RELOCATION_FLEXIBILITIES may lead to underinvestment by mispricing the value
   of PV_PROJECTS. incorporating these OPTIONS_ENCOURAGES EARLY_COMMITMENT of
   the PV_INVESTMENT. moreover, summation of INDIVIDUAL_OPTION_PRICES may not
   be a GOOD_APPROXIMATION of the TRUE_PORTFOLIO_VALUE, as interactions among
   options exist.  these findings may improve ALLOCATION_EFFICIENCY of
   RENEWABLE_INVESTMENTS, ACCELERATE_ENERGY_TRANSITION and BENEFIT_INVESTORS,
   FUNDING agencies and regulators.  2023 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS offer CLEAN_ENERGY_PRODUCTION and have the potential to

   of PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS, building integrated PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS, offer
   ADDITIONAL_ADVANTAGES beyond TRADITIONAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS as they do not
   require LARGE_SWATCHES of land as they are integrated into existing
   BUILDINGS. unfortunately, despite these benefits, UNCERTAINTY regarding
   FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES make valuing PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS difficult, which
   reduces their attractiveness.  in scenarios with UNCERTAINTY in
   FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES, investors have MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY in the form
   of deferring INVESTMENT and considering VARIOUS_SYSTEM_SIZES, which can
   affect and improve SYSTEM_VALUATIONS. considering that variation in
   ELECTRICITY_PRICES can jeopardize the TIMELY_INSTALLATION of an optimally
   sized PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM, the objective of this paper is to propose a
   REAL_OPTION_FRAMEWORK to model the price of ELECTRICITY and account for the
   value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY when valuing building integrated
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. a CASE_STUDY using the framework is conducted to
   calculate the net PRESENT_VALUE of a real_life building integrated
   PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECT in daejeon, SOUTH_KOREA. it was found that the
   OPTIMAL_DECISION for would_be building integrated PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM_OWNERS
   is to wait to invest in building integrated PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS when there
   are HIGH_LEVELS of UNCERTAINTY in FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES. this holds true
   even if the net PRESENT_VALUES for systems without options are positive.
   when applying this strategy to the apartment complex in the CASE_STUDY, it
   generated an OPTION_VALUE of approximately $87,000.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

   developed for the EVALUATION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_PROJECTS with a capacity
   greater than 100 kw in france.  FRENCH_LEGISLATION that regulates these
   types of projects presents two REAL_OPTIONS: on the one hand, the producer
   has a put option that consists of choosing between a feed_in tariff system
   and ELECTRICITY_MARKET_SALE_PRICES every year, and this put OPTION_COINCIDES
   with PUBLIC_SUBSIDIES granted by the FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION. on the other
   hand, the FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION has a CALL_OPTION that provides a benefit to
   the PUBLIC_SECTOR. this OPTION_SUPPOSES a limit on the subsidized PRODUCTION
   of ELECTRICITY and reduces the value of the project to the promoter.  the
   value of the put option is 4.28  per mwh generated.  the extended net
   PRESENT_VALUE has a value of 5.26 million euros.  the BREAKEVEN_POINT of the
   project is achieved with an increase of 59% in the regulated rate.  this
   means that the FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION must increase the value of

AB RENEWABLE_GENERATION_SOURCES still have not achieved ECONOMIC_VALIDITY in
   many countries including KOREA, and require subsidies to support the
   transition to a low_carbon economy.  an initial feed_in tariff (fit) was
   adopted to support the deployment of RENEWABLE_ENERGY in KOREA until 2011
   and then was switched to the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard (rps) to implement
   more market_oriented MECHANISMS. however, HIGH_VOLATILITIES in
   ELECTRICITY_PRICES and subsidies under the RPS_SCHEME have weakened
   INVESTMENT_INCENTIVES. in this study we estimate how the
   MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES under the RPS_SCHEME affect the
   OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS of ENERGY_STORAGE_PROJECTS, whose importance is
   increasing rapidly because they can mitigate the variability and UNCERTAINTY
   of SOLAR and WIND generation in the POWER_SYSTEM. we applied
   MATHEMATICAL_ANALYSIS based on real_option methods to estimate the
   OPTIMAL_TRIGGER_PRICE for INVESTMENT in energy_storage projects with and
   without MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES. we found that the OPTIMAL_TRIGGER_PRICE
   of SUBSIDY called the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATE (rec) under
   MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES is 10.5% higher than that under no
   PRICE_VOLATILITIES. if the VOLATILITY of the REC_PRICE gets doubled, the
   project requires a 26.6% higher OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PRICE to justify the
   INVESTMENT against the increased RISK. in the end, we propose an
   AUCTION_SCHEME that has the advantage of both rps and fit in order to
   minimize the FINANCIAL_BURDEN of the SUBSIDY_PROGRAM by eliminating
   SUBSIDY_VOLATILITY and find the minimum willingness_to_accept price for
   investors.  the author(s) 2021.

AB VOLATILITY is an IMPORTANT_PARAMETER when evaluating INVESTMENTS using the
   REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD. for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS, the VOLATILITY of
   CASH_FLOW continuously changes, because as NEW_INFORMATION and knowledge are
   gathered, there is less FORESEEN_VARIATION. this paper proposes an extended
   recombining TRINOMIAL_TREE_MODEL, where the CHANGING_VOLATILITY is used to
   GENERATE_TRANSITION_PROBABILITIES. the CHANGING_VOLATILITY is generated
   using a CONSOLIDATION_PROCESS where MULTIPLE_RANDOM_VARIABLES, including the
   MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, CARBON_PRICE, and lending rate, are integrated
   into a low_dimension STOCHASTIC_PROCESS. a two_factor LEARNING_CURVE is used
   to model the changes of INVESTMENT_COST. we apply the proposed model to
   ANALYZE_SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_GENERATION_INVESTMENT in CHINA. the
   results show VOLATILITY with changing feature.  compared with
   CONSTANT_VOLATILITY, CHANGING_VOLATILITY may advance INVESTMENT_DECISIONS
   and change the PROJECT_VALUE. COMPLETE_GRID_PARITY_POLICY in the
   SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY is infeasible because the OPPORTUNITY_COST brought by the
   option of delaying cannot be offset.  the CHANGING_VOLATILITY may produce a
   lower and equally EFFECTIVE_SUBSIDY_LEVEL compared with CONSTANT_VOLATILITY.
   a CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme is helpful in advancing INVESTMENTS in
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY, which is reflected in improvements in PROJECT_VALUE,
   advancements in INVESTMENT_DECISIONS, and reductions in the required
   SUBSIDY_LEVEL.  2020 elsevier b.v.

AB in this paper, we investigate whether INVESTMENTS in
   BATTERY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS, coupled with existing PV_PLANTS, are profitable in
   the phasing out of incentives.  in detail, we analyze the
   INVESTMENT_DECISION of a HOUSEHOLD, who has already invested in a PV_PLANT
   and has to decide whether and when to invest in the adoption of
   BATTERY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS (bss). we provide a REAL_OPTION_MODEL to determine
   the value of the opportunity to invest and its OPTIMAL_TIMING. the existing
   PV_PLANT gives the HOUSEHOLD the opportunity to invest in BSS_ADOPTION, and
   this opportunity is analogous to a CALL_OPTION. our findings show that
   NEGATIVE_NPV_INVESTMENTS may turn to be profitable if the HOUSEHOLD
   optimally exercises the option to defer.  the greater the VOLATILITY of
   ENERGY_PRICES, the greater the OPTION_VALUE to defer, and the greater the
   OPPORTUNITY_COST of waiting (i.e., the greater the ENERGY_PRICES_DRIFT), the
   smaller the OPTION_VALUE to defer.  2020, SPRINGER_NATURE_SWITZERLAND_AG.

AB RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION based on SOLAR_ENERGY is deemed to be a
   KEY_INSTRUMENT to reduce the CARBON_FOOTPRINT of MODERN_ECONOMIES.
   collectively, BUILDINGS are an energy_intensive consumption sector.
   therefore, existing BUILDING_ROOFTOPS are seen as a target for massively
   deploying PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) DISTRIBUTED_GENERATION. nevertheless, estimating
   the benefits and RISKS of investing in ROOFTOP_PV_SYSTEMS is indeed a
   CHALLENGING_TASK due to the LARGE_UNCERTAINTIES that affect tariffs,
   TECHNOLOGY_COSTS, and REGULATORY_POLICY. after reviewing the literature and
   identifying the CURRENT_GAPS, this ARTICLE develops a method based on
   REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY for appraising INVESTMENTS in PV_GENERATION_SYSTEMS to
   be installed on the rooftop of existing BUILDINGS. the OPTION_VALUE of
   differing the INVESTMENT_DECISION and the problem of the OPTIMAL_TIME to
   invest in IRREVERSIBLE_PV_ASSETS are addressed by an advanced
   VALUATION_METHOD based on STOCHASTIC_SIMULATION, LINEAR_REGRESSION, and
   backward DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING. in this work, returns of self_generation PV
   INVESTMENTS are subjected to uncertainties upon declining INVESTMENT_COSTS
   and fluctuating ELECTRICITY_TARIFFS, which are represented by
   APPROPRIATE_EXOGENOUS_STOCHASTIC_PROCESSES. in order to test the
   practicability of the proposed decision_making framework, the VALUATION of
   an exemplary rooftop pv_system in a GOVERNMENT_BUILDING is considered.
   results show that while STANDARD_APPRAISAL_METHODS wrongly reject the
   ROOFTOP_PV_PROJECT now and in the FUTURE, the OPTION_VALUATION_METHOD finds
   optimal to hold the opportunity open in order to reconsider to invest later.
   in addition, the method provides an OBJECTIVE_VALUE of the OPPORTUNITY_COST
   of using the building rooftop for another purpose.  the proposed
   VALUATION_APPROACH would result in better INVESTMENT_ALLOCATION and faster
   development of distributed PV_POWER_CAPACITY contributing thereby to enhance
   the SUSTAINABILITY of CURRENT_ENERGY_SYSTEMS.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

AB under the uncertain and the FLEXIBILITY required conditions, the
   CONVENTIONAL_CAPITAL budgeting techniques are insufficient to decide the
   most FEASIBLE_INVESTMENT due to their STATIC_NATURE.
   CLASSICAL_REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_TECHNIQUES have been used for
   VARIOUS_INVESTMENT_OPTIONS such as deferment and abandonment.  although
   these techniques help to evaluate the projects in UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTS,
   they still follow the static, CERTAIN_BOOLEAN_LOGIC_ASSUMPTIONS. therefore,
   further improvement in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION has been introduced with
   the usage of FUZZY_LOGIC. FUZZY_LOGIC is applied by binomial and
   black_scholes REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_METHODS up to date, but not with the
   TRINOMIAL_LATTICE. moreover, types_1 and 2 FUZZY_NUMBERS are used; however,
   the INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS are not analyzed in detail in the
   REAL_OPTION_VALUATION. in this ARTICLE, we propose an
   INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_TRINOMIAL_LATTICE REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_MODEL for a
   SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECT. while valuing the DEFERMENT_OPTION,
   EXPERT_OPINIONS, two DIFFERENT_VOLATILITY_METHODS, and a tailor_made
   ELECTRICITY price_forecasting model are used.  according to our results, the
   DEFERMENT_OPTION is valuable and delaying the start of the project provides
   a much higher expanded net PRESENT_VALUE than an IMMEDIATE_START. the
   contribution of this ARTICLE is that the UNCERTAINTY in the
   REAL_OPTION_VALUATION is modeled from a BROADER_PERSPECTIVE with
   INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS by taking the hesitancy of the decision_maker
   and the MARKET into account.  consequently, the proposed method would
   increase the accuracy of the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION in UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTS
   such as RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SECTOR.   1988_2012 ieee.

AB SUSTAINABLE_BUILDING_TECHNOLOGIES such as PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV) have
   PROMISING_FEATURES for ENERGY saving and GREENHOUSE_GAS (ghg)
   EMISSIONS_REDUCTION in the building sector.  nevertheless, adopting these
   technologies generally requires SUBSTANTIAL_INITIAL_INVESTMENTS. moreover,
   the MARKET for these technologies is often very vibrant from the
   technological and ECONOMIC_STANDPOINTS. therefore, investors typically find
   it more attractive to DELAY_INVESTMENT on the PV_TECHNOLOGIES. they can
   alternatively prepare "SOLAR READY_BUILDINGS" that can easily adopt
   PV_TECHNOLOGIES later in FUTURE; when their prices are lower, ENERGY_PRICE
   are higher, or STRICTER_ENVIRONMENTAL_REGULATIONS are in place.  in
   SUCH_CASES, the DECISION_MAKERS should be equipped with

   in price and efficiency of the PV_TECHNOLOGIES over time.  it also has an

AB CONVENTIONAL_NPV_ANALYSIS often reveals that the price of ELECTRICITY
   produced by SOLAR_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGY is significantly higher than that
   produced by FOSSIL_FUEL using POWER_PLANTS. in the context of BANGLADESH,
   this difference becomes more marked because the GOVERNMENT of
   BANGLADESH_SUBSIDIZES the GRID_ELECTRICITY, offering it to consumers at a
   COST below the COST of PRODUCTION. as a result, any COMMERCIAL_VENTURE to
   supply SOLAR powered ENERGY must find its markets only in off GRID_AREAS
   where the GOVERNMENT_TRANSMISSION_SYSTEM has not reached.  however, FINANCE
   theory tells us that an INVESTMENT must be evaluated not only the basis of
   its COSTS and returns, but also on the basis of its RISK. the RISK of a
   given PV based POWER_PLANT_PROJECT to supply a town or village can be
   evaluated using the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD. this reveals that the options
   inherent in the installment and operations of a PV_GRID lower its COST to
   make it more competitive with ELECTRICITY.  2012 icdret.

AB since the LATE_1960S, there has been interest in the UNITED_STATES, and
   later in other nations, to capture SOLAR_ENERGY in space and efficiently
   transmit it back to earth.  starting with his SEMINAL_PAPER in 1968, dr.
   peter glaser began architecting a PROTOTYPE_SYSTEM that was further explored
   by the us department of ENERGY in the CONCEPT_DEVELOPMENT and
   EVALUATION_PROGRAM. this INITIAL_STUDY showed that the project was very
   ambitious and fraught with technical, social, and ECONOMIC_UNCERTAINTIES.
   ENERGY_ECONOMICS and the lack of a reliable,
   HIGH_FREQUENCY_SPACE_LAUNCH_CAPABILITY brought most RESEARCH to a halt in
   the 1990s.  this paper proposes a RATIONAL_TECHNICAL_STRATEGY to
   REFOCUS_SOLAR_POWER_SATELLITE (sps) RESEARCH. it suggests a 30 YEAR_TIMELINE
   for PROGRAM_MILESTONES and ANALYZES_POTENTIAL TECHNICAL_PERFORMANCE.
   REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS is used to MANAGE_UNCERTAINTY and permits the
   exploration of POSSIBLE_FUTURES that are dependent on LAUNCH_COSTS and
   ELECTRICITY_MARKET_PRICES. we propose that the u.s.  can make progress
   toward implementing a SMALL_SCALE_SPS_SYSTEM within several decades if work
   is begun now on TECHNOLOGY_DEVELOPMENT and on addressing societal concerns.

AB the feed_in tariff policy is widely used to promote the development of
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY. CHINA also adopts feed_in tariff policy to attract greater
   INVESTMENT in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION. this study employs
   REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD to assess the OPTIMAL_LEVELS of feed_in tariffs in 30
   provinces of CHINA. the uncertainties in CO2_PRICE and INVESTMENT_COST are
   considered.  a method that integrates the backward DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING
   ALGORITHM and least_squares MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is used to solve the model.
   the results demonstrate that the feed_in tariffs of 30 PROVINCES_RANGE from
   0.68 rmb/kwh to 1.71 rmb/kwh, and the AVERAGE_LEVEL is 1.01 rmb/kwh.  on
   this basis, we find that the levels of sub_regional feed_in tariff announced
   in 2013 are no longer appropriate and should be adjusted as soon as
   possible.  we have also identified the implications of
   TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and CARBON_EMISSION trading schemes, as well as the
   importance of strengthening ELECTRICITY_TRANSMISSION. it has been suggested
   that the CHINESE_GOVERNMENT takes DIVERSE_MEASURES, including increasing
   RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT, establishing and improving a
   NATIONWIDE_CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme and accelerating the construction
   of electricity_transmission infrastructure, to reduce the required feed_in
   tariff and promote the development of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION.

AB the TRADITIONAL_NET PRESENT_VALUE_APPROACH to INVESTMENT in MICROGRID_ASSETS
   does not take into account the INHERENT_UNCERTAINTIES in FUEL_PRICES, COST
   of TECHNOLOGY, and MICROGRID_LOAD_PROFILE. we propose a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH
   to MICROGRID_INVESTMENT, which includes SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) and
   gas_fired GENERATION_ASSETS. likewise the (n, m) EXCHANGE_LITERATURE in
   REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS, we examine cases with interdependency and independency
   of FUEL_PRICE and the COST of PV_TECHNOLOGY. this work, however, makes a
   MAJOR_CONTRIBUTION by the way of introducing a NEW_PARAMETER, which is
   defined as the elasticity of the OPTION_VALUE to prices and is used in the
   formulation of closed FORM_SOLUTIONS. we further extend the (1, 1)
   EXCHANGE_PROBLEM here to include OPERATIONAL_FLEXIBILITY of MICROGRID, such
   that optimal switching between INVESTMENT, suspension and re_activation can
   be examined.  2015, springer science+business media NEW_YORK.

AB the HIGH_LEVEL of UNCERTAINTY characterising the FUTURE_MARKET_DEMAND in

   STRATEGIC_INVESTMENT_EVALUATION_MODELS that foresee the possibility of
   determining and managing UNCERTAINTY in order to be able to fully take the
   potentials for creating the value associated with it.  by using the approach
   of REAL_OPTIONS in this work, a MATHEMATICAL_MODEL is provided for choosing
   a STRATEGIC_INVESTMENT in the PHOTOVOLTAIC_INDUSTRY; this model allows
   MANAGEMENT to handle the UNCERTAINTY of the demand that cannot otherwise be
   dealt with by using the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) as a tool to
   SUPPORT_DECISIONS. moreover, it will be shown how this EVALUATION_MODEL is
   able to reduce the RISK of a STRATEGIC_INVESTMENT, if compared to the NPV,

AB with increasing penetration of distributed ENERGY_RESOURCES (ders), the

   SIGNIFICANT_PROPERTY of FLEXIBILITY (for example, the option to

   is not applicable.  in this paper, we propose the utilization of
   REAL_OPTIONS (ro) method in MAKING_DECISION on the ENTRY_TIME for
   RESIDENTIAL_DERS, which considers the decrease in INITIAL_COSTS and can
   recommend the best INVESTMENT_TIMING for home owners, in order to maximize
   the profits, thus FLEXIBILITY_VALUE is addressed in making INVESTMENTS.

AB promoting RENEWABLE_ENERGY has been a KEY_INGREDIENT in ENERGY_POLICY
   seeking to de_carbonize the ENERGY_MIX and will continue to do so in the
   FUTURE given the EUROPEAN_UNION's high ambitions to further
   CURB_CARBON_EMISSIONS. a WIDE_RANGE of instruments has been suggested and
   implemented in VARIOUS_COUNTRIES of the eu.  a PROMINENT_POLICY promoting
   INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_TECHNOLOGIES is the use of feed_in tariffs, which
   has worked well at LARGE_SCALE in, e.g.  GERMANY, but which has only been
   implemented in a very limited way in countries such as the uk.  being
   subject to ENVIRONMENTAL_UNCERTAINTIES, however, RENEWABLES cannot be seen
   in isolation: while renewables_based technologies such as WIND and
   SOLAR_ENERGY, for example, suffer from UNCERTAIN_LOADS depending on
   ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS, HYDROPOWER allows for the storage of water for
   release at PEAK_PRICES, which can be treated as a premium (partially)
   offsetting higher UPFRONT_INVESTMENT_COSTS. in addition, ELECTRICITY_PRICES
   will respond to changes in ELECTRIC_CAPACITY in the MARKET, which is often
   neglected in STANDARD_INVESTMENT_MODELS of the ELECTRICITY_SECTOR. this
   PAPER_CONTRIBUTES to the existing literature in two ways: it provides a
   review of a renewables_based TECHNOLOGY in a SPECIFIC_POLICY_CONTEXT and
   provides ADDITIONAL_INSIGHT by employing a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to
   investigate the SPECIFIC_CHARACTERISTICS of RENEWABLES and their associated
   uncertainties in a stylized setting taking explicitly into ACCOUNT_MARKET
   effects of INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. the prices of the model are determined
   endogenously by the supply of ELECTRICITY in the MARKET and by
   EXOGENOUS_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_UNCERTAINTY. the inclusion of MARKET_EFFECTS
   allows us to capture the FULL_IMPACT of PUBLIC_INCENTIVES for companies to

AB given the interest in the commercialization of affordable,
   CLEAN_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, we examine the prospects of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS
   (PV). we consider the question of how to transition to a
   MEANINGFUL_PERCENTAGE of SOLAR_ENERGY in a SUSTAINABLE_MANNER and which
   policies are most effective in accelerating adoption.  this paper develops a
   stochastic DYNAMIC_MODEL of the adoption of SOLAR_PV in the residential and
   COMMERCIAL_SECTOR under two sources of UNCERTAINTY _ the price of
   ELECTRICITY and COST of SOLAR. the ANALYTIC_RESULTS suggest that a HIGH_RATE
   of INNOVATION may DELAY_ADOPTION of a NEW_TECHNOLOGY if the consumer has
   RATIONAL_PRICE_EXPECTATIONS. we simulate the model across
   ALTERNATIVE_RATES_TECHNOLOGICAL change, ELECTRICITY_PRICES, subsidies and
   CARBON_TAXES. it is shown that there will be a displacement of
   INCUMBENT_TECHNOLOGIES and a widespread shift towards SOLAR_PV in under 30
   YEARS _ and that this can occur without CONSUMER_INCENTIVES and CARBON
   PRICING. we show that these policies have a MODEST_IMPACT in accelerating
   adoption, and that they may not be an EFFECTIVE_PART of CLIMATE_POLICY.
   instead, results demonstrate that further TECHNOLOGICAL_CHANGE is the
   CRUCIAL_DETERMINANT and MAIN_DRIVER of adoption.  further, results indicate
   that subsidies and taxes become increasingly ineffective with higher rates
   of TECHNOLOGICAL_CHANGE.  2016.

AB this PAPER_CONTRASTS the FINANCIAL_BENEFIT of grants given to RESEARCH and
   DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS with the reduction in MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY they
   impose, which implies a loss in the value of the project.  to quantify this
   loss of value, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS has been adopted as the most
   SUITABLE_FRAMEWORK to assess and QUANTIFY_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY. this idea
   is illustrated by the case of a RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_PROJECT in
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY, specifically concentrated SOLAR_POWER. our results show
   that the value added by the grants is less than the NOMINAL_INCENTIVES
   received as a result of the loss of FLEXIBILITY for MANAGERS; they cannot
   apply CERTAIN_OPTIONS such as deferral, nor can they abandon the project.
   therefore, a break_even grant is proposed that equals the
   FINANCIAL_INCENTIVE with the loss of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY. under this
   break_even point, the grant should be rejected.  this paper will create
   awareness for both POLICY_MAKERS and PRIVATE_COMPANIES regarding a more
   ACCURATE_ASSESSMENT of grants to RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT FUNDING as well as

AB SOLAR_CELLS made of SILICON based on upgraded METALLURGICAL_ROUTES (umg_si)
   are becoming a REAL_OPTION to the standard polysilicon_based
   multicrystalline (mc_si) devices.  a lot of RESEARCH at wafer and CELL_LEVEL
   has been carried out so far.  however, there is little experience in
   REAL_OPERATION_CONDITIONS of PV modules based_on umg_si feedstock and few of
   these studies have been published up to present.  this work presents a
   COMPARATIVE_STUDY between typical mc_si and umg_si modules, manufactured
   following exactly the same wafer_to_module procedure and evaluated in
   REAL_OUTDOOR_CONDITIONS. the results after eight months of exposition to
   OUTDOOR_CONDITIONS show a very close ENERGY_PRODUCTION for both types of
   modules.  due to their lower COST and SIMILAR_PERFORMANCE, modules made from
   UMG_SILICON_FEEDSTOCK are a more ECONOMIC_OPTION and could play an

AB SPACE_SYSTEMS are characterized by a LARGE_INITIAL_INVESTMENT and 15_20
   YEAR_DESIGN_LIFETIME to increase the RETURN_ON_INVESTMENT. no
   MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY is available for most SPACE_SYSTEMS. therefore, the
   TRADITIONAL_APPROACH adopted by SPACE_SYSTEMS_OPERATORS is to build_in
   reliability in the satellite and to replace the system in case of
   OBSOLESCENCE or failure.  this lack of FLEXIBILITY may translate to RISK for
   the operator such as RISK of SYSTEM_FAILURE, RISK of
   TECHNOLOGY_OBSOLESCENCE, RISK of COMMERCIAL_OBSOLESCENCE for
   COMMERCIAL_MISSIONS or RISK of a CHANGE_IN_REQUIREMENTS. autonomous on_orbit
   servicing can change this paradigm and bring FLEXIBILITY to SPACE_SYSTEMS.
   the case of SATELLITE_UPGRADE using on_orbit servicing is investigated in
   the PARTICULAR_EXAMPLE of COMMERCIAL_MISSIONS. a DYNAMIC_FRAMEWORK, based on
   REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY, is used to account for the FLEXIBILITY offered by
   on_orbit servicing.  the case of a COMMERCIAL_MISSION under
   UNCERTAIN_REVENUES is first studied.  the effect of the upgrade on the
   REVENUE_STREAM and the VOLATILITY of the MARKET are two MAJOR_PARAMETERS.
   the value of the FLEXIBILITY can be a SIGNIFICANT_PART of the TOTAL_VALUE of
   the project, emphasizing the importance of DYNAMIC_VALUATION_TECHNIQUES
   rather than CONVENTIONAL_VALUATION_TECHNIQUES such as net PRESENT_VALUE
   (NPV). the case of a GEOSYNCHRONOUS_EARTH_ORBIT (geo)
   COMMUNICATION_SATELLITE facing UNCERTAIN_DEMAND with a limited capacity is
   presented as a more SPECIFIC_EXAMPLE. upgrading the SOLAR_PANELS would
   restore the power level on_board the satellite, thus allowing to increase
   the SATELLITE_CAPACITY. three options are embedded in this case: the option
   to replace, to service and to abandon the mission.  results on the value of
   the option to abandon are presented for a
   BASELINE_SILICON_SOLAR_PANEL_SATELLITE with a payload designed for end of
   LIFE_POWER. FUTURE_WORK will focus on comparing a SERVICEABLE_SATELLITE with
   TRADITIONAL_SATELLITES, SATELLITES with HIGH_RADIATION RESISTANT_SOLAR_CELLS
   and SATELLITES designed for a SHORTER_LIFETIME.  2003 by CAROLE_JOPPIN.

AB in this paper, we propose a method of optimizing FINANCIAL_SUBSIDIES and
   PUBLIC_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENTS for
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, rather than optimizing FINANCIAL_SUBSIDY
   alone.  by combining SYSTEM_DYNAMICS with REAL_OPTION_MODELS, we capture
   DYNAMIC_COMPLEX_INTERACTIONS among investors, consumers, and policymakers,
   as well as FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES of KEY_ENERGY, economic, and
   ENVIRONMENTAL_FACTORS. our method thereby makes SUBSIDY_OPTIMIZATION more
   accurate and flexible.  to evaluate our model, we apply it to the
   KOREAN_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SUBSIDY and determine that the GOVERNMENT can achieve
   the PHOTOVOLTAIC_DIFFUSION_TARGET, even if it reduces the TOTAL_SUBSIDY by
   $us 359.5. million.  the OPTIMAL_APPROACH is to increase
   RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT FUNDING by $us 310.4. million while reducing the

   represent "seals of approval" to the m&S_COMMUNITY and thus
   FACILITATE_RISK_MITIGATION when adopting NEW_TECHNOLOGIES and paradigms.
   while m&S_STANDARDIZATION is imperative, a framework for quantifying
   return_on_investment (ROI) of m&S_STANDARDIZATION is not currently
   available.  as realized by LORD_WILLIAM_THOMSON_KELVIN (1824_1907), who
   invented the KELVIN_SCALE of temperature, "when you can measure what you are
   speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but
   when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your
   knowledge is of a meager and UNSATISFACTORY_KIND" this paper is an attempt
   to devise a framework for quantifying ROI of m&S_STANDARDIZATION. the
   approach takes into consideration of both time and UNCERTAINTY.
   TIME_CONSIDERATION is based on the concept of net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV)
   espoused in the OMB_CIRCULAR no.  a_94 revised, 29 october 1992. NPV, the
   discounted monetized value of NET_BENEFITS, provides a level playing field
   for time distributed COSTS and benefits by reducing a stream of COSTS and
   benefits to a single number.  in the absence of UNCERTAINTY, ROI can be
   formulated as the ratio of the NPV to the PRESENT_VALUE (PV) of COSTS.
   UNCERTAINTY_TREATMENT is based on REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (also called
   REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION). this VALUATION_APPROACH allows FLEXIBILITY in
   execution and has gained foothold in the decision_making process.  combining
   time and UNCERTAINTY_CONSIDERATIONS, ROI can be defined as the ratio of the
   expanded NPV (ENPV) to the PV of COSTS that reduces to the ratio of the NPV
   to PV of COSTS when there is no UNCERTAINTY. this QUANTIFICATION_FRAMEWORK
   is general and amendable to changes.

AB the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER of portfolios is an IMPORTANT_TOOL for MANAGEMENT
   because decision_makers can see how much return can be achieved using the
   TOTAL_ASSETS of the corporation and at the same time the level of RISK. but,
   in order to create the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER, each PROJECT_NEED to be analyzed
   previously _ CAPITAL_INVESTMENT, PRODUCTION_PROFILE, CAPITAL_COST_ETC. at
   the level of projects usually there are many REAL_OPTIONS available for
   MANAGEMENT over the life of the project _ drill ADDITIONAL_WELLS, develop a
   SATELLITE_OIL & GAS_FIELD, OIL_PRODUCTION, make farm_out etc.  when properly
   used, these REAL_OPTIONS have value and are an IMPORTANT_TOOL for reducing
   the RISK of NPV. then, a more REALISTIC_EFFICIENT_FRONTIER should consider
   the value of these REAL_OPTIONS, but in the practice of oil and GAS_BUSINESS
   this does not always occur.  in this paper, the study of the impact of some
   REAL_OPTIONS on the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER of portfolios intends to use an
   integrated methodology including REAL_OPTIONS, PORTFOLIO_THEORY and
   MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION. three deep_water OIL_PROJECTS are combined in a
   portfolio, where the decisor has an option to sell the project if the
   PAYBACK_PERIOD is not accomplished.  for the case of HYPOTHETICAL_SITUATION,
   PRELIMINARY_RESULTS indicated when there is availability of REAL_OPTIONS and
   MANAGEMENT that can use them optimally, there are two MAIN_CONSEQUENCES: 1)
   the distribution of NPV is moved to the right and the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER is
   displaced towards more return and RISK is reduced; 2) this way of thinking
   is important in order to a more EFFECTIVE_POLICY for managing those
   variables that GENERATE_SYSTEMATIC_RISKS (price, geology, etc). this model
   gives a better view of the TRUE_VALUE of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITIES in the
   context not only of projects, but on the portfolio that is much more
   realistic.  copyright 2008, society of PETROLEUM_ENGINEERS.

   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT by considering UNCERTAIN_FACTORS such as
   CO2_PRICE, non_renewable ENERGY COST, INVESTMENT_COST and MARKET_PRICE of
   ELECTRICITY. a phase_out mechanism is built into the model to reflect the
   long_term changes of SUBSIDY_POLICY. we apply the proposed model to
   empirically evaluate the INVESTMENT_VALUE and OPTIMAL_TIMING for
   SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA. our EMPIRICAL_RESULTS show
   that the CURRENT_INVESTMENT_ENVIRONMENT in CHINA may not be able to attract
   IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT, while the development of CARBON_MARKET helps advance
   the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME. a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS is conducted to
   investigate the dynamics of INVESTMENT_VALUE and OPTIMAL_TIMING under the
   changes of unit generating capacity, SUBSIDY_LEVEL, MARKET_PRICE of
   ELECTRICITY, CO2_PRICE and INVESTMENT_COST. it is found that the
   HIGH_INVESTMENT_COST and the VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY and CO2_PRICES, are
   not conducive to attract IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT. instead, increasing the level
   of SUBSIDY, promoting TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and maintaining the stability
   of MARKET are useful to STIMULATE_INVESTMENT.  2016 elsevier b.v.

AB for many YEARS, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) has been perceived as an
   ATTRACTIVE_PROJECT_VALUATION alternative to the traditional discounted
   CASH_FLOW_ANALYSIS (dcf). right now, one can see evidence of a growing
   dispersion in the applicability of the method among VARIOUS_INDUSTRIES
   (particularly MINERALS, COAL, gas and petroleum) and the banking sector.
   this is because of its potential to VALUE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY including
   possibilities for delaying INVESTMENTS or reformulating the operating
   strategies of the company.  the REAL_OPTION_APPROACH enables one to
   calculate a projects FUNDAMENTAL_VALUE in approximating the MARKET one.  the
   basis of OPTION_THEORY is STOCHASTIC_MODELING of underlying ASSETS _ the
   preferred, commonly used ROA_METHODOLOGY, introduced by copeland and
   antikarov (2001), is called the mad (marketed ASSET_DISCLAIMER) approach.
   it assumes that an underlying asset, which is the (gross) PRESENT_VALUE of
   the project (PV), changes with time according to the
   MULTIPLICATIVE_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS derived as DISCRETE_BINOMIAL_APPROXIMATION
   of GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION (gbm). in addition, the MAD_ASSUMES, that a
   TWIN_ASSET of the underlying instrument is calculated in a COMMON_WAY_NET
   PRESENT_VALUE (NPV). the twin_asset assumption fulfills the
   THEORETICAL_CRITERIA required for FAIR_OPTION_VALUATION in no_arbitrage
   conditions.  the PAPER_DELIVERS_EMPIRICAL_ARGUMENTS arguing that indirect
   MODELING of pvs, according to the STANDARD_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS, do not
   properly REFLECT_REALITY. the calculations were based on the VALUATION of a
   HARD_COAL_PROJECT with FLEXIBILITY _ the methodology has included
   MULTIPLICATIVE_PRICE MODELING (that parameter has served as so called
   REFERENTIAL_ASSET) and, consequently, built a CONSECUTIVE_PVS_TREE, where
   RESPECTIVE_PRESENT_VALUES have been adjusted by REFERENTIAL_PRICE_LEVELS.
   moreover, the paper has emphasized that the option_to_wait changes the
   structure of PROJECTS_CASH_FLOW and PV_TREES, depending on the waiting
   period.  in conclusion, the arguments have been derived from the consecutive
   MODELING of a PV_ASSET is more accurate than indirect constructing of it in
   the MADS_MULTIPLICATIVE_MODE.  2015, POLSKA_AKADEMIA_NAUK. all rights

AB limiting GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS has continually gained importance since
   the KYOTO_PROTOCOL became effective in 2005. a variety of efforts have been
   made to reduce ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and introduce supposedly clean and
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY that can replace fossil fuelbased ENERGY_SOURCES. however,
   many CLEAN_ENERGY_SOURCES are not economically viable by themselves, and,
   therefore, GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDIES are necessary to provide
   SUFFICIENT_ECONOMIC_MOTIVATION for the installation of NEW_TYPES of ENERGY.
   for that reason, it is necessary to develop a method for reasonably and
   accurately determining an APPROPRIATE_LEVEL of GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY for
   PRIVATE_ENTITIES. in this paper we propose a real option_based framework for
   rationally quantifying the amount of GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY required by
   PRIVATE_ENTITIES in order to implement a CLEAN_ENERGY_GENERATION_SYSTEM. a
   CASE_STUDY that involved the installation of a PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM in an
   AVERAGE_HOUSEHOLD in seoul, KOREA was conducted in order to verify the
   proposed framework.  the proposed framework is expected to help
   ENERGY_POLICYMAKERS choose the PROPER_LEVEL of GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY that will
   effectively encourage PRIVATE_ENTITIES to install CLEAN_ENERGY_SYSTEMS
   without wasting taxpayers' money.  2012 AMERICAN_SOCIETY of CIVIL_ENGINEERS.

AB in the last decade, the FINANCIAL_ATTRACTIVENESS of PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV)
   systems has been increasing due to the rapid and CONSTANT_IMPROVEMENTS of
   PV_TECHNOLOGIES and the introduction of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SUPPORT_MECHANISMS.
   under these circumstances, RESIDENTIAL_ELECTRICITY_CONSUMERS can benefit
   from INVESTMENTS in DOMESTIC_PV_SYSTEMS. INVESTMENT_DECISIONS in PV_SYSTEMS
   can be assessed with well_known discounted cash flows criteria such as the
   COST of ENERGY and the net PRESENT_VALUE. these types of analyses either
   recommend abandoning the project or investing immediately.  however, due to
   FAST_IMPROVEMENTS in PV_TECHNOLOGIES, especially in the last few YEARS,
   options to POSTPONE_INVESTMENTS in PV_SYSTEMS can be valuable.  these
   options can be assessed with REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY. this paper proposes a
   REAL_OPTIONS_METHODOLOGY for the assessment of DOMESTIC_PV_SYSTEMS,
   considering the expected evolution of PV_TECHNOLOGIES and the option to
   DELAY_INVESTMENT. the methodology employs a NORMALIZATION_TECHNIQUE to
   illustrate, in a simple and INTUITIVE_MANNER, the convenience of the
   DELAY_OPTION. two CASE_STUDIES based on real aggregated data for the uk are
   presented.  the first CASE_STUDY_ILLUSTRATES the methodology, whereas the
   second is an EXTENSIVE_STUDY meant to provide insights about INVESTMENTS in
   DOMESTIC_PV_SYSTEMS in the uk.  the results indicate the circumstances that
   drive and DISINCENTIVIZE_INVESTMENTS in DIFFERENT_PV_TECHNOLOGIES.
   additionally, it is shown that the option to DELAY_INVESTMENT is a
   POTENTIAL_DRIVER for INVESTMENTS in emerging organic_based PV_TECHNOLOGIES.
   copyright  2012 JOHN_WILEY & sons, ltd.  the use of REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY can
   lead to the enhancement of the ECONOMIC_ATTRACTIVENESS of
   DOMESTIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) projects.  additionally, it can facilitate the
   penetration of organic_based PV_TECHNOLOGIES for the generation of power in
   the DOMESTIC_SECTOR. this paper proposes a real options_based methodology
   with the AFOREMENTIONED_CHARACTERISTICS for the planning of
   DOMESTIC_PV_SYSTEMS and illustrates the application of the methodology with

AB the variable, UNCERTAIN_NATURE of climate imposes RISK in using SOLAR and
   BUILDING_TECHNOLOGIES, such as NATURAL_VENTILATION (nv). to maximize the
   POTENTIAL_BENEFIT from nv while reducing RISK, a building could be designed
   for nv along with the "REAL_OPTION" to install MECHANICAL_COOLING in the
   FUTURE, if needed.  TRADITIONAL_EVALUATION_PROCEDURES use EXPECTED_VALUES,
   which fail to acknowledge the value of UNCERTAINTY when SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE
   is a non_linear function of the uncertain variable.  a
   REAL_OPTIONS_METHODOLOGY is proposed to evaluate the
   FLEXIBLE_BUILDING_DESIGN under CLIMATE_UNCERTAINTY. a building
   ENERGY_SIMULATION is used to obtain PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTIONS of the
   COST_SAVINGS of the option_based NV_STRATEGY and of the time when (if) the
   MECHANICAL_COOLING system is installed.  a simplified
   STOCHASTIC_TEMPERATURE_GENERATOR is used, and it may be used to evaluate
   REAL_OPTIONS for other technologies sensitive to FUTURE_CLIMATE. the results
   of a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS provide information to project investors on a)

AB the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_THEORY is based on the concepts of the options
   traded in STOCK_MARKETS applied to REAL_PROJECTS, where those are considered
   options of INVESTMENT. the methodology enables the VALUATION of a manager's
   FLEXIBILITY to adapt and review his estimates for INVESTMENT_DECISIONS if
   MARKET or project's processes have any change.
   REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_CONSIDERS_FLEXIBILITY caused by uncertainties as a
   KEY_POINT of an ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS of an INVESTMENT. this paper intends to
   develop a REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_MODEL to be applied in
   INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITIES where uncertainties related to the
   INITIAL_PRODUCTION_RATE and the DECLINE_RATE are KEY_VARIABLES, considering
   an EXPONENTIAL_DECLINE. we consider a scenario where we have an
   EXPLORATORY_PROJECT with HIGH_LEVES of uncertainties regarding
   POSSIBLE_FUTURE_PRODUCTION. based on EXPLORATORY_INFORMATION about the field
   the company will decide if it will develop the reservoir or not.  these
   UNCERTAIN_VARIABLES are modeled by STOCHASTIC_PROCESSES causing impact on
   the PRODUCTION of an OIL_FIELD and in its ECONOMIC_RETURNS as a result.  the
   model's MAIN_IDEA is the definition of a decision_making rule including the
   VALUATION of the FLEXIBILITY from the possibility of delaying an INVESTMENT
   in an OIL_FIELD due to better GEOLOGICAL_INFORMATION. we used a
   CONTINUOUS_TIME REAL_OPTION_MODEL to estimate the OPTION_VALUE and
   INVESTMENT_TRIGGER_POINT and compared the results to estimates from
   EVALUATION using traditonal discounted CASH_FLOW
   ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY. the EVALUATION_MODEL is applied to a set of
   PRODUCTION_CURVES based on REAL_PRODUCTION_DATA from a producing reservoir
   located in the BRAZILIAN_NORTHEASTERN_COAST. PRELIMINARY_RESULTS show that
   the INVESTMENT _ rule is different from that of TRADITIONAL_NPV, that is,
   insvest as long as NPV > 0. the methodology can be used as an
   ADDITIONAL_ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS decision_making tool to help MANAGERS decide in
   an UNCERTAIN_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT. this model does not eliminate the

AB GREEN_HOUSE_GAS (ghg) EMISSIONS have been tied to GLOBAL_CLIMATE change.
   governments are seeking ways to help improve performance of their countries
   on this ENVIRONMENTAL_ISSUE through introduction of
   VARIOUS_POLICY_INSTRUMENTS. one POPULAR_POLICY_INSTRUMENT that seems to have
   gained credibility with explicit mention of its application in the
   KYOTO_PROTOCOL is the use of permit trading and cap_and_trade MECHANISMS.
   VARIOUS_POLITICAL_REGIONS, countries, and even corporations have introduced,
   are introducing or seek to introduce this mechanism.  organizations
   functioning within this environment will need to manage their resources
   appropriately to remain competitive.  organizations will either have the
   opportunity to purchase EMISSIONS_CREDITS (offsets) from a MARKET trading
   scheme or seek to reduce their EMISSIONS through DIFFERENT_MEASURES. some
   measures may include INVESTMENT in NEW_TECHNOLOGIES that will reduce their
   reliance on ghg emitting practices.  in many countries, LARGE_ORGANIZATIONS
   and INSTITUTIONS_GENERATE their OWN_POWER to operate their facilities.  much
   of this power is generated (or bought) from ghg producing TECHNOLOGY.
   SPECIFIC_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES such as WIND and
   SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY may become more FEASIBLE_ALTERNATIVES
   available to a LARGE_PERCENTAGE of these organizations if they are able to
   take advantage and incorporate the MARKET for GHG_EMISSIONS trading in their
   analyses.  to help organizations evaluate INVESTMENT in these
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES we introduce a REAL_OPTIONS based model that
   will take into CONSIDERATION_UNCERTAINTIES associated with the TECHNOLOGY
   and those associated with the ghg trading MARKET. the REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
   will consider both the stochastic (UNCERTAINTY) nature of the exercise price
   of the TECHNOLOGY and the STOCHASTIC_NATURE of the MARKET trading price of
   the GHG_EMISSIONS. managerial and POLICY_IMPLICATIONS will be discussed.

AB PRECISE_VALUATION of the ECONOMIC_EFFICIENCY of RISKY_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS in
   the MINERAL_SECTOR has a DIRECT_IMPACT on the range of FUTURE_INVESTMENTS.
   since the mid_90s, a number of enterprises have also been giving increased
   attention to the VALUATION of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY that cannot normally be
   estimated with classical discounted CASH_FLOW (dcf) analysis.  this has been
   the result of a development in the REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) and the
   simplification of its ALGORITHMS, most of which have been achieved through:
   incorporating LATTICE_MODELS,  introducing a single
   UNCERTAIN_PROJECT_PARAMETER (GROSS_PRESENT_VALUE, PV) as an underlying
   instrument,  assuming that the underlying asset follows the
   MULTIPLICATIVE_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS,  introducing the marketed
   ASSET_DISCLAIMER (mad) assumption.  unfortunately, in most cases, MODELS
   constructed on the abovementioned assumptions and modifications are not
   consistent with REAL_PROJECTS. some analysts recognize that PROJECT_PVS
   might not follow the MULTIPLICATIVE_PROCESS, which could have a
   DIRECT_IMPACT on the PROJECTS_VALUE. in order to improve the MAD_APPROACH,
   the paper proposes a modified model where the MULTIPLICATIVE_TREE is
   replaced with an additive one.  in addition, methods of
   ADDITIVE_VOLATILITY_CALCULATION and DIVIDEND_ADJUSTMENTS were suggested.

AB GREEN_HOUSE_GAS (ghg) EMISSIONS have been tied to GLOBAL_CLIMATE change.
   one POPULAR_POLICY_INSTRUMENT that seems to have gained credibility with
   explicit mention of its application in the KYOTO_PROTOCOL is the use of
   permit trading and cap_and_trade MECHANISMS. organizations functioning
   within this environment will need to manage their resources appropriately to
   remain competitive.  organizations will either have the opportunity to
   purchase EMISSIONS_CREDITS (offsets) from a MARKET trading scheme or seek to
   reduce their EMISSIONS through DIFFERENT_MEASURES. some measures may include
   INVESTMENT in NEW_TECHNOLOGIES that will reduce their reliance on ghg
   emitting practices.  in many countries, LARGE_ORGANIZATIONS and
   INSTITUTIONS_GENERATE their OWN_POWER to operate their facilities.  much of
   this power is generated (or bought) from ghg producing TECHNOLOGY.
   SPECIFIC_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES such as WIND and
   SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY may become more FEASIBLE_ALTERNATIVES
   available to a LARGE_PERCENTAGE of these organizations if they are able to
   take advantage and incorporate the MARKET for GHG_EMISSIONS trading in their
   analyses.  to help organizations evaluate INVESTMENT in these
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES we introduce a REAL_OPTIONS based model that
   will take into CONSIDERATION_UNCERTAINTIES associated with the TECHNOLOGY
   and those associated with the ghg trading MARKET. the REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
   will consider both the stochastic (UNCERTAINTY) nature of the exercise price
   of the TECHNOLOGY and the STOCHASTIC_NATURE of the MARKET trading price of
   the GHG_EMISSIONS.

AB combustion of COAL_ACCOUNTS for about 75% of TOTAL_POWER_GENERATION in
   CHINA. the GLOBAL_CALL for CO2_EMISSIONS_REDUCTION, exposure to OIL_RISKS
   and their bearing on ENERGY_SECURITY, require CHINA to properly determine
   its FUTURE_ENERGY_POLICIES. this study has attempted to quantify the
   benefits provided by current chinese feed_in tariff (fit) policy for
   SOLAR_POWER_GENERATION by using REAL_OPTION PRICING approach to estimate the
   value of SOLAR_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in the face of
   UNCERTAIN_FOSSIL_FUEL_PRICES and learning effects in SOLAR_TECHNOLOGIES. the
   OPTIMAL_SOLUTION as calculated renders the governments FIT_EFFORT as a
   SUFFICIENT_MECHANISM to make SOLAR an economically COMPETITIVE_ALTERNATIVE
   in CHINAS_ENERGY FUTURE. in addition, OPTIONS_VALUES in terms of
   internalized EXTERNAL_COSTS and variation in the level of fit are also
   compared.  SIMULATION_RESULTS reveal the OPTIONS_VALUE to be significantly
   greater when EXTERNAL_COSTS are internalized.  nevertheless, it was found
   that the AVERAGE_CURRENT_FIT_LEVEL is non_optimal, and should be increased
   to between 1.5 rmb/kwh and 1.7 rmb/kwh to ensure
   MAXIMUM_INVESTMENT_INCENTIVE with MINIMAL_GOVERNMENT_EXPENDITURES.
   furthermore, given SOLAR to be an ATTRACTIVE_ALTERNATIVE for the FUTURE, his
   STUDY_HYPOTHESIZES that SOLAR_POWER_USE in CHINA can potentially reduce
   CO2_EMISSIONS by approximately 1.3% by 2020 compared to the 2005 level.

AB the net PRESENT_VALUE (nvp) is an IMPORTANT_CONCEPT in INVESTMENT_DECISIONS.
   as ingersoll and ross have pointed out, the FUTURE_FLUCTUATION of
   INTEREST_RATES is expected to have SIGNIFICANT_EFFECTS on the PRESENT_VALUE
   (PV) of the project concerned.  if INTEREST_RATES are expected to fall off
   in the next year, deferring an INVESTMENT for yet another year is likely to
   be more gainful even if its CURRENT_NPV is positive.  the effects of
   deferment can be valued from its CORRESPONDING_AMERICAN_OPTION_VALUE. berk
   proposed a SIMPLE_CRITERION for INVESTMENT_DECISIONS which incorporate this
   AMERICAN_OPTION_VALUE of INVESTMENT. the simplicity of this model is
   obtained from the APPROPRIATE_USAGE of a CALLABLE_BOND. it is admirable that
   this model does not postulate any assumptions on the behavior of
   INTEREST_RATES. but this construction of the model has the pros and cons.
   it is easy to implement this model in business because the only adjustment
   required in this model is to replace the INTEREST_RATE in NPV with the
   CALLABLE_RATE. on the other hand, the properties of this criterion have not
   been clarified.  in this paper we analyze berk's model under the assumption
   that INTEREST_RATES follow the GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION (gbm). by assuming
   the movement of INTEREST_RATES, we can derive an ANALYTICAL_SOLUTION for the
   OPTIMAL_TIMING for the INVESTMENTS in terms of the parameters of the gbm.
   this enables us to perform COMPARATIVE_STATICS and SIMULATION. these
   RESULTS_EXTRACT some properties of berk's model and help the DECISION_MAKERS
   in implementing berk's model.

AB this study proposes a POLICY_EVALUATION_MODEL from the perspective of
   GOVERNMENT and investors.  the proposed model, which
   INTEGRATES_AMERICAN_OPTION_METHOD and two_factor LEARNING_CURVE method, can
   be used to evaluate the UNIT_DECISION_VALUE and save_path rate for
   RENEWABLE_ENERGY_DEVELOPMENT and examine the existence of BALANCE_POINT of
   interest.  several UNCERTAIN_FACTORS including non_renewable ENERGY COST,
   CARBON_PRICE, RENEWABLE_ENERGY_COST, and PRICE_SUBSIDY are all considered in
   this model.  the model has been applied to evaluate the SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC
   (PV) POWER_GENERATION in CHINA. our EMPIRICAL_RESULTS show that
   REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS (ROA) is more effective than net PRESENT_VALUE_ANALYSIS
   (NPV) when handling UNCERTAINTY. under CURRENT_LEVEL of SUBSIDY, the
   GOVERNMENT would SUFFER_LOSS and the investors could benefit so that it is
   difficult to achieve the balance of interest during the PLANNING_PERIOD.
   with the reduction of SUBSIDY_RATE, they can achieve the balance of

AB phased PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_PROCESSES, also known as stage and
   GATE_MANAGEMENT_PROCESSES (sgmp), are widely used to macro and micro_manage
   projects from EARLY_EVALUATION, to sanctioning and close out.  these tools
   tend to disassemble by discipline the activities and decisions disseminated
   along the life of a project and re_bundle them into standardized
   SEQUENTIAL_PHASES, with the underlying intention to narrow down
   uncertainties and multiply the PROJECT_VALUE. by virtue of the IMPLICIT_SET
   of routines and checks, sgmps have successfully brought a great deal of
   discipline in the allocation of HUMAN and FINANCIAL_CAPITAL among competing
   prospects _ albeit not enough.  UNCERTAINTY is the scapegoat our industry
   too often resorts to to justify otherwise INEXPLICABLE_FAILURES. the
   variability embedded in the oil and GAS_BUSINESS (nature,
   RAW_MATERIALS_PRICES, etc.) undeniably plays to the detriment of our
   industry's bottom line but it is not the only delinquent in the game.
   ultimately, opportunities are passed over on account of
   INAPPROPRIATE_ASSESSMENT of the value of UNCERTAINTY and of acquiring the
   information (VALUE_OF_INFORMATION, voi) necessary to narrow it down.
   finance_derived REAL_OPTIONS have long been proposed to guide
   INVESTMENT_DECISIONS and overcome the limitations of npv_based approaches.
   however, REAL_OPTIONS have failed to win proselytes because of
   UNDENIABLE_MATHEMATICAL_COMPLICATION and an ill_fated fame to be too
   volatile a concept to fit into 150_year OLD_OIL and GAS_INDUSTRY. a
   NOVEL_APPROACH is presented that complements the structured framework of
   sgmps with VOI_EVALUATION. the result is a PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TOOL that
   preserves the merits of sgmps while warranting improved
   FINANCIAL_DISCIPLINE. copyright 2008, society of PETROLEUM_ENGINEERS.

AB SOLAR_ENERGY is rapidly emerging thanks to the decreasing INSTALLATION_COST
   of SOLAR_PANELS and the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard imposed by
   STATE_GOVERNMENTS, which gave birth to the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CREDIT (rec) and
   the ALTERNATIVE_COMPLIANCE_PAYMENT (acp). to make profits from the
   REC_MARKET in addition to reduced ENERGY_COSTS, more and more home and
   BUSINESS_OWNERS choose to INSTALL_SOLAR_PANELS. recently, third_party
   FINANCING has become a COMMON_PRACTICE in SOLAR_PANEL_INVESTMENTS. we
   discuss OPTIMAL_TIMING for the host to potentially buy back the SOLAR_PANELS
   after being installed for a period of time and how to incorporate the
   OPTIMAL_TIMING into a POWER_PURCHASE_AGREEMENT between the host and the
   third_party developer.  because the REC_PRICE is a MAJOR_SOURCE of
   UNCERTAINTY and also due to the acp capping the REC_PRICE, we first propose
   a REC_PRICE forecasting model that specifically considers the ACP_VALUES.
   then by a modified REAL_OPTION_STRUCTURE, we model the BUYBACK_CONTRACT as a
   REAL_OPTION and solve it with an approximate DYNAMIC_PROGRAM based
   MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION_METHOD. we find that as the ACP_VALUE_INCREASES, the
   value of the BUYBACK_OPTION also increases under OPTIMAL_TIMING. the method
   used does not only apply to SOLAR_PROJECTS but also to other distributed
   RENEWABLE_PROJECTS that are third_party financed, such as WIND generations.

AB TRANSFORMATIVE_TECHNOLOGIES such as PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) system have
   PROMISING_FEATURES for SUBSTANTIAL_REDUCTIONS in CARBON_EMISSIONS and
   ENVIRONMENTAL_FOOTPRINTS of the building sector.  nevertheless, INVESTMENT
   in PV_SYSTEMS requires SUBSTANTIAL_IMPLEMENTATION_COSTS followed by a
   LONG_PERIOD of recovering the invested CAPITAL through SAVINGS in
   ELECTRICITY_BILLS. an APPROPRIATE_INVESTMENT_VALUATION_METHOD is needed to
   CONDUCT_TRADEOFF_ANALYSIS between ELECTRICITY_SAVING benefits and
   IMPLEMENTATION_COSTS, and find the PROPER_INVESTMENT_VALUES of PV_SYSTEMS.
   currently, the VALUATION of INVESTMENTS in PV_SYSTEMS are made based on the
   CONVENTIONAL_METHODS, such as PAYBACK_PERIOD, RETURN_ON_INVESTMENT (ROI) and
   net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) (muldavin 2010; prindle and de fontaine 2009).
   however, these methods have CONSIDERABLE_LIMITATIONS for the
   PROPER_VALUATION of the INVESTMENTS in PV_SYSTEMS for BUILDINGS. the
   existing methods do not address two MAJOR_ISSUES that impact the value of
   SUCH_INVESTMENTS: UNCERTAINTY and timing.  we PRESENT_NEW_APPROACH towards
   the VALUATION of INVESTMENTS in PV_SYSTEM for BUILDINGS that challenges the
   THEORETICAL_FOUNDATION of CURRENT_INVESTMENT_VALUATION_METHODS. we utilize
   the REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY to overcome the limitations of existing
   INVESTMENT_VALUATION_METHODS. we propose a NOVEL_INVESTMENT_VALUATION_MODEL
   that accounts for changes in the IMPLEMENTATION_COSTS of PV_SYSTEMS as well
   as UNCERTAINTY about their RESPECTIVE_ELECTRICITY saving benefits.  this
   INVESTMENT_VALUATION_MODEL can be used to find the OPTIMAL_TIME for
   implementing PV_SYSTEMS for BUILDINGS, as well as the FINANCIAL_VALUE of
   properly_timed INVESTMENTS in PV_SYSTEMS.  2012 asce.

AB ENERGY_PLAYS a very IMPORTANT_ROLE in society.  it has been one of the
   MAIN_DRIVERS in the organization of civilization and, before that, in
   evolution.  the availability of relatively INEXPENSIVE_ENERGY could solve
   many other problems, for example supplying FRESH_WATER through DESALINATION.
   an economy based on SOLAR_ENERGY has been the dream of many for many YEARS.
   it would be great to only depend on the freely distributed ENERGY of the
   sun, which is available everywhere.while SOLAR_ENERGY might include a
   WIDE_RANGE of POTENTIAL_ENERGY_SOURCES, the SOLAR_ENERGY considered here is
   restricted to SOLAR_CONCENTRATORS, SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS, and
   ARTIFICIAL_SOLAR_CHEMICAL_PROCESSES. after these are considered, both the
   related uncertainties and the POSSIBLE_RANGE of CLIMATE_VARIABILITY are
   explored.  characteristics of the VARIOUS_TECHNOLOGIES, uncertainties, and
   POTENTIAL_CLIMATE effects are also identified.  an ANALYSIS_EXPLORES the
   SOLAR_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, uncertainties, and vulnerabilities related to

AB this study makes two contributions to the existing literature analyzing the
   BUSINESS_CASE for SPACE_BASED SOLAR_POWER (sbsp). first, we present detailed
   five_year TECHNOLOGY_DEVELOPMENT and FUNDING plans anchored on a
   SBSP_CONCEPT developed by an existing STARTUP_COMPANY (HELIOSAT). we
   MODEL_ENTRY in two markets that are usually not considered by existing
   studies: supplying power for SPACE_RADAR_SYSTEMS and forward operating
   bases.  entry into these markets will occur in stages, depending on
   MARKET_CONDITIONS. second, we develop an integrated DECISION_TREES and
   REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS to account for MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY in responding to
   resolution of UNCERTAINTY along the PROJECT_TIMELINE. the
   DECISION_TREE_INCORPORATES the MAJOR_TECHNOLOGICAL_UNCERTAINTIES and
   CRITICAL_EVENTS that could occur during the first four YEARS of
   SYSTEM_DEVELOPMENT. the REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS_EVALUATES the COMPOUND_OPTIONS
   resulting from staged entry in each of the two considered markets.  the
   methodology has two MAJOR_BENEFITS. it first provides an estimate of the
   value of FLEXIBILITY and shows that the added value of REAL_OPTIONS makes
   the project economically very attractive for PRIVATE_INVESTORS across large
   ranges of MODEL_PARAMETERS. second, while NPV_DETERMINES only whether the
   firm should initiate the project or not at time 0, our methodology provides
   guidance what OPTIMAL_DECISIONS to make in the FUTURE _ under what
   conditions to enter NEW_MARKETS, when to expand PRODUCTION, and when to
   abandon the project.

AB this PAPER_DISCUSSES_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES in a MICROGRID_SYSTEM consisting
   of COGENERATION_SYSTEM and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION under UNCERTAINTY in
   the NATURAL_GAS_PRICE. although incentives for introducing distributed
   ENERGY_SYSTEM_INCREASE these days, volatile NATURAL_GAS_PRICES make its
   INVESTMENT in GAS_FUEL distributed GENERATION_SYSTEMS_RISKY. therefore, it
   is important to evaluate the RISK under UNCERTAINTY and find
   FLEXIBLE_STRATEGIES which reduce the exposure to FUEL_PRICE_VOLATILITY. we
   take the REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to ANALYZE_INVESTMENT_DECISION. by varying
   the parameter of PRICE_VOLATILITY, we find that the
   OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY depends on the level of UNCERTAINTY. as

AB as INVESTMENT in RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS is increasing at a
   RAPID_PACE, it is important to investigate whether delaying or otherwise
   timing these INVESTMENTS can maximize LONG_TERM_INVESTMENT_GAINS.
   CONVENTIONAL_FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS_METHODS for evaluating INVESTMENT_DECISIONS
   in solar_electric system are all based on a one_time installation of the
   PV_SYSTEMS and cannot be applied to analyze the benefit of delayed and
   staged INVESTMENT. SUCH_BENEFITS could be declining COSTS of PV_SYSTEMS thus
   tempting investors to hold off and wait for a better moment to invest.  this
   paper proposes a DECISION_MAKING_FRAMEWORK using the REAL_OPTION_METHOD to
   analyze the OPTIMUM_TIME to invest in a RESIDENTIAL_PV_SYSTEM in
   DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS. a reference RESIDENTIAL_HOUSE is used to test the
   effect of DIFFERENT_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES. the results show the type of
   staged INVESTMENT of installing RESIDENTIAL_PV_SYSTEM that maximizes the
   long_term payoff.  this reveals when the option to DELAY_INVESTMENT is
   preferred.  the supporting SOURCE_CODE and data are available for download

AB the VOLATILITY concerning INDUSTRIAL_PROJECTS is a SIGNIFICANT_PARAMETER in
   the analysis of RISK in INVESTMENTS. when FINANCIAL_ASSETS are evaluated,
   the VOLATILITY can be determined by HISTORICAL_DATA of ASSETS. however, when
   working with INDUSTRIAL_PROJECTS, usually, there are no HISTORICAL_DATA,
   which makes VOLATILITY a CRITICAL_PARAMETER to be determined.  the objective
   of this study is the adoption and comparison of three approaches to
   determine PROJECT_VOLATILITY in a TRANSFORMATION_INDUSTRY. two of the
   adopted approaches, the "consolidated VOLATILITY_APPROACH of copeland and
   antikarov (2001)" and the "estimated VOLATILITY of herath and park (2002)"
   were obtained from a LITERATURE_REVIEW of methods for calculation of
   VOLATILITY of INVESTMENT_PROJECTS. the third approach is a NEW_PROPOSAL for
   VOLATILITY_CALCULATION entitled: "the estimate of VOLATILITY through the
   dependence between PV_O and PV". a TRADITIONAL_ANALYSIS of INVESTMENTS in an
   INDUSTRIAL_PROJECT was performed, in which these three DIFFERENT_APPROACHES
   for determination of VOLATILITY were adopted.  lastly, a comparison of the
   three approaches is presented, in which the difference between the highest
   and the lowest VOLATILITY_VALUES is nineteen PERCENTILE_POINTS.

AB this STUDY_MODELS FUNDAMENTAL_FEATURES of current and PROSPECTIVE_POLICIES
   ENCOURAGING_ADOPTION of RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) systems.  a key
   finding is that time_of_day (tod) PRICING can enhance or worsen the
   ECONOMICS of PV_SYSTEMS. moreover, increased responsiveness of
   ELECTRICITY_DEMAND to its PRICE_DIMINISHES the effectiveness of tod PRICING
   in the absence of net metering, but does not affect it otherwise.  an
   application to PLAUSIBLE_CONDITIONS in the state of INDIANA, usa, shows that
   CURRENT_POLICIES are unlikely to TRIGGER_ADOPTION by a risk_neutral
   forward_looking RESIDENTIAL_CUSTOMER. however, adoption of PV_SYSTEMS can be
   induced if the FEDERAL_TAX_CREDIT is increased to cover 48% of CAPITAL_COST
   (instead of the current 30%), which could imply a COST to the
   FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT of about $0.95/kw of INSTALLED_CAPACITY depending on the
   panel's size.  we demonstrate that implementation of tod PRICING can
   TRIGGER_ADOPTION under a range of on_ and off_peak price combinations.  but
   our analysis also shows that the cost_effectiveness of tod PRICING is
   enhanced at higher ratios of on_peak to off_peak prices.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD.
