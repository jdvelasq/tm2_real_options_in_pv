Title: COMPREHENSIVE_EFFECTIVENESS_ASSESSMENT of
ENERGY_STORAGE_INCENTIVE_MECHANISMS for PV_ESS projects based on compound
REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
nowadays, the photovoltaic_energy storage system (pv_ess) has not
achieved large_scale development. the role of ESS_INCENTIVE_MECHANISMS
has been emphasized for promoting the DIFFUSION of pv_ess TECHNOLOGY.
therefore, to explore REASONABLE_ESS_INCENTIVE_MECHANISMS in CHINA, this
paper develops a compound REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL by considering the
flexibilities and uncertainties of the INVESTMENT and OPERATIONAL_STAGE.
the impact of the CARBON_EMISSION trading MARKET,
AUXILIARY_SERVICE_MARKET, and DIFFERENT_ESS_INCENTIVE_POLICIES and their
SYNERGISTIC_ACTIONS on pv_ess INVESTMENT have been explored by
considering the SOCIAL_WELFARE of all related stakeholders. moreover, a
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS on the scale of expanding the INVESTMENT and
INCENTIVE_INTENSITY for ess is conducted. the results show that the
ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY is more favorable for investing in the pv_ess
project. the INVESTMENT will be brought forward 2 YEARS compared to the
situation without INCENTIVE_POLICY. in addition, from the perspective of
SOCIAL_WELFARE, the effects of the combinations of three
ESS_INCENTIVE_POLICIES are better than any single ESS_POLICY, and the
PROJECT_VALUE and SOCIAL_WELFARE_INCREASES by at least 3.46 and 7.99
million yuan, respectively. ILLUSTRATIVE_EXAMPLES can provide references
for the GOVERNMENT and investors in promoting the construction of pv_ess
projects.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: price and SUBSIDY under UNCERTAINTY: REAL_OPTION_APPROACH to
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS on ENERGY_STORAGE with SOLAR_PV
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_GENERATION_SOURCES still have not achieved ECONOMIC_VALIDITY in
many countries including KOREA, and require subsidies to support the
transition to a low_carbon economy. an initial feed_in tariff (fit) was
adopted to support the deployment of RENEWABLE_ENERGY in KOREA until 2011
and then was switched to the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard (rps) to
implement more market_oriented MECHANISMS. however, HIGH_VOLATILITIES in
ELECTRICITY_PRICES and subsidies under the RPS_SCHEME have weakened
INVESTMENT_INCENTIVES. in this study we estimate how the
MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES under the RPS_SCHEME affect the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS of ENERGY_STORAGE_PROJECTS, whose importance
is increasing rapidly because they can mitigate the variability and
UNCERTAINTY of SOLAR and WIND generation in the POWER_SYSTEM. we applied
MATHEMATICAL_ANALYSIS based on real_option methods to estimate the
OPTIMAL_TRIGGER_PRICE for INVESTMENT in energy_storage projects with and
without MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES. we found that the
OPTIMAL_TRIGGER_PRICE of SUBSIDY called the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATE
(rec) under MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES is 10.5% higher than that under
no PRICE_VOLATILITIES. if the VOLATILITY of the REC_PRICE gets doubled,
the project requires a 26.6% higher OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PRICE to justify
the INVESTMENT against the increased RISK. in the end, we propose an
AUCTION_SCHEME that has the advantage of both rps and fit in order to
minimize the FINANCIAL_BURDEN of the SUBSIDY_PROGRAM by eliminating
SUBSIDY_VOLATILITY and find the minimum willingness_to_accept price for
investors.  the author(s) 2021.

Title: how to promote the WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of
PHOTOVOLTAIC_MICROGRIDS under INVESTMENT_UNCERTAINTY? a
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS in CHINA
Abstract:
```
MICROGRIDS can integrate the PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_PROCESS of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY and realize the SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT of
POWER_SYSTEMS. however, it remains difficult to promote the
WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_MICROGRIDS due to
HIGH_COSTS. this study develops a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for it to assess
peak_valley ELECTRICITY_PRICES and ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES under the
uncertainties in the INITIAL_INVESTMENT dynamic. the ADJUSTMENT_MECHANISM
is also established in the REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL to analyze the tendency of
INCENTIVE_POLICIES changing with UNCERTAINTY. the results demonstrate
that the OPTIMAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES of 31 provinces in
CHINA_RANGE from 0.30 rmb/kwh to 1.05 rmb/kwh, and the OPTIMAL_RATES of
peak_valley price range from 3.09 to 6.32. on this basis, we conduct a
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS of OPTIMAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY and peak_valley
price rate and find that the threshold goes down significantly as the
COST goes down. however, RAPID_COST_VARIATIONS and fluctuations make
DEVELOPERS_HESITATE to invest, which will seriously hinder the
WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of PV_MICROGRIDS. this study extends the
understanding of participants' strategies in a DYNAMIC_FRAMEWORK by
analyzing the impacts of UNCERTAINTY on INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. we suggest
developers pay attention to the changes in the MARKET and reduce
INVESTMENT_RISKS by signing OPTION_CONTRACTS. a
STABLE_INVESTMENT_MARKET_CORRESPONDS to smaller peak_valley price rates
and less ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES. the policy_maker should provide
flexible and EFFICIENT_INCENTIVES depending on the APPLICATION_SCENARIO.
it is also suggested that in areas lacking SOLAR_RESOURCES, the
GOVERNMENT should not only speed up the establishment of peak_valley
ELECTRICITY_PRICES but also provide long_term subsidies.  2022

Title: deferring REAL_OPTIONS with SOLAR RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES
Abstract:
```
this STUDY_EVALUATES_INVESTMENT in a utility_scale SOLAR_POWER_PLANT
using a real_options approach (ROA). although roas have been widely
applied in the literature, the deferring option for a utility_scale
POWER_PLANT has not been fully examined, especially within the context of
the UNIQUE_SUBSIDY_PROGRAM of SOLAR RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES (srecs)
in the usa. using data from one of the most developed
SOLAR_ELECTRICITY_MARKETS in NEW_JERSEY, we incorporate the time_varying
VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY_PRICES and bounded SREC_PRICES in real_options
VALUATION. our results show that deferring REAL_OPTIONS generates
SIGNIFICANT_VALUE for the project that the
TRADITIONAL_DISCOUNT_CASH_FLOW_APPROACH_IGNORES. it is thus optimal to
postpone the INVESTMENT in more than 70% of cases. in addition, we
demonstrate that debt FINANCING is crucial for
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS.  2022 ELSEVIER_INC.

Title: DECISION_SUPPORT for INVESTMENTS in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES under
uncertainties
Abstract:
```
INVESTMENT in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES is one of the
CLIMATE_MITIGATION_STRATEGIES that can significantly reduce
GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS in the ENERGY_SECTOR. however, in
DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, INVESTMENT is challenged by
HIGH_CAPITAL_EXPENDITURES and several uncertainties. this PAPER_AIMS to
provide DECISION_SUPPORT for INVESTMENT in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_PROJECTS by
evaluating the COMPARATIVE_ATTRACTIVENESS of shifting ENERGY_SOURCES from
FOSSIL_FUELS to RENEWABLES and nuclear. applying the
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH (ROA), this PAPER_CALCULATES the value of the
FLEXIBILITY to postpone the INVESTMENT_DECISION and identifies the
OPTIMAL_TIMING (described here as the TRIGGER_PRICE of COAL) for shifting
to SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. then, VARIOUS_UNCERTAINTIES are
considered, such as COAL and ELECTRICITY_PRICES, NEGATIVE_EXTERNALITY of
using FOSSIL_FUELS, and the RISK of a NUCLEAR_ACCIDENT, which are
modelled using GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION, POISSON_PROCESS, and
BERNOULLI_PROBABILITY. applying the ROA_MODEL in the case of the
PHILIPPINES, results find that investing in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY is a
better option than continuing to use COAL for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION.
however, contrary to CONVENTIONAL_OPTION_VALUATION_RESULT that waiting is
a better strategy, this study found that delaying or postponing the
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS may lead to POSSIBLE_OPPORTUNITY_LOSSES. among the
AVAILABLE_SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES, geothermal is the most attractive
with TRIGGER_PRICES of COAL equal to usd 49.95/ton, followed by nuclear
(usd 58.55/ton), WIND (usd 69.48/ton), SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (usd
72.04/ton), and HYDROPOWER (usd 111.14/ton). also, the occurrence of jump
(extreme) prices of COAL, raising the current feed_in_tariff, and
considering NEGATIVE_EXTERNALITIES can decrease the TRIGGER_PRICES, which
FAVOR_INVESTMENTS in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGIES. moreover, the RISK of a
NUCLEAR_DISASTER favors INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES over
nuclear due to the HUGE_DAMAGE_COSTS once an ACCIDENT_OCCURS. results
provide bases for POLICY_RECOMMENDATIONS toward achieving a more secure
and SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SECTOR for DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES that are highly
dependent on imported FOSSIL_FUELS.  2022. the authors.

Title: a compound REAL_OPTION_APPROACH for determining the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PATH for rpv STORAGE_SYSTEMS
Abstract:
```
the use of residential photovoltaic_storage systems may produce
LARGE_BENEFITS to owners and has expanded rapidly in RECENT_YEARS.
nonetheless, LARGE_UNCERTAINTIES regarding the PROFITABILITY of these
systems make it necessary to INCORPORATE_FLEXIBILITIES in their
ECONOMIC_EVALUATIONS. this paper offers a NEW_METHOD to evaluate the
COMPOUND_FLEXIBILITY of both the option of delaying INVESTMENTS and the
option of further expanding the capacity of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_MODULES
and BATTERIES during the INVESTMENT_HORIZON. FLEXIBILITY is modeled as a
compound REAL_OPTION, whose value is computed using a NOVEL_METHOD that
we call compound least SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO (clsm). the model is applied
to the INVESTMENT_DECISIONS associated to a residential
photovoltaic_storage system. results suggest that investors should use
the proposed CLSM_METHOD in the ECONOMIC_VALUATION of multi_stage
projects, since considering only a single FLEXIBILITY could promote
sub_optimal decisions. moreover, in our CASE_STUDY, we show that it is
optimal to break the INVESTMENT down into two steps or more in 36% of
FUTURE_SCENARIOS, on average.  copyright  2022 by the iaee. all rights

Title: determining the OPTIMAL_OPERATION and MAINTENANCE_CONTRACT_PERIOD of
PV_POVERTY_ALLEVIATION_PROJECTS based on REAL_OPTIONS and
COOPERATIVE_GAME: evidence from RURAL_CHINA
Abstract:
```
CHINA's PHOTOVOLTAIC POVERTY_ALLEVIATION power stations (ppaps) properly
combine POVERTY_ALLEVIATION and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION while also
meeting RURAL_ENERGY_DEMANDS. the FUNDAMENTAL_PROBLEM is how to optimize
the benefits of ppaps during its limited lifetime. using the
post_operation of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POVERTY_ALLEVIATION_POWER_PLANTS as a
starting point, this paper proposes a model combining REAL_OPTION_THEORY
and COOPERATIVE_GAME to determine the IDEAL_CONTRACT_PERIOD of service
committed by the GOVERNMENT to the operation and maintenance (o&m)
company, thus providing a reference for both parties. the model's
validity and applicability are verified by incorporating a ppaps from
HENAN_PROVINCE in CHINA as an example; ultimately, the factors
influencing the o&M_CONTRACT_PERIOD are ranked using the sobol
GLOBAL_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS. the results show that when the SOLAR
industry's environment is positive, the GOVERNMENT is more inclined to
sign long_term contracts with o&M_COMPANIES. in contrast, the more the
GOVERNMENT invests in the facilities, the more likely both parties will
sign short_term contracts. furthermore, the o&m company's
CAPITAL_INVESTMENT in the POWER_STATION has a DIRECT_IMPACT on the
CONTRACT_PERIOD. finally, CORRESPONDING_POLICY_RECOMMENDATIONS are
proposed for FUTURE_O&M_CONTRACTS.  2023 author(s).

Title: valuing PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS by compound REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
MEETING_ELECTRICITY_DEMAND with RENEWABLE_GENERATION requires spending
trillions of dollars in INVESTMENTS exposed to FINANCIAL_RISK.
RENEWABLE_PROJECTS have MULTIPLE_STRATEGIC_REAL_OPTIONS to
MANAGE_INVESTMENT_RISK, but they are usually priced separately in
isolation. this paper proposes a framework for valuing
MULTISTAGE_DECISIONS in a grid_scale PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_PLANT under
UNCERTAINTY. the project is modelled as a COMPOUND_PORTFOLIO of
AMERICAN_SEQUENTIAL and mutually EXCLUSIVE_OPTIONS to defer, expand and
relocate. the COMPOUND_OPTIONS are jointly priced by a hierarchically
nested least_squares MONTE_CARLO ALGORITHM. the
FRAMEWORK_INCORPORATES_UNCERTAINTIES related to decreasing COSTS in
SOLAR_TECHNOLOGY and the EMERGENCE of more PROFITABLE_RENEWABLE_TARIFFS
elsewhere. the results show that the value of the
COMPOUND_OPTION_PORTFOLIO significantly exceeds the value of the single
DEFERRAL_OPTION commonly considered in practice. ignoring expansion and
RELOCATION_FLEXIBILITIES may lead to underinvestment by mispricing the
value of PV_PROJECTS. incorporating these OPTIONS_ENCOURAGES
EARLY_COMMITMENT of the PV_INVESTMENT. moreover, summation of
INDIVIDUAL_OPTION_PRICES may not be a GOOD_APPROXIMATION of the
TRUE_PORTFOLIO_VALUE, as interactions among options exist. these findings
may improve ALLOCATION_EFFICIENCY of RENEWABLE_INVESTMENTS,

Title: revenue and RISK of VARIABLE_RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY_INVESTMENT: the
CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT under HIGH_MARKET_PENETRATION
Abstract:
```
WIND and SOLAR_POWER_DEPRESS_MARKET_PRICES at times when they produce the
most. this has been termed the CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT, and its magnitude
has been established within the ECONOMIC_LITERATURE on current and
FUTURE_MARKETS. although it has a SUBSTANTIAL_IMPACT on the revenue of
VRE_TECHNOLOGIES, the CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT is neglected in the CAPITAL
budgeting literature, including portfolio_ and REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY. in
this paper, we present an ANALYTICAL_FRAMEWORK that explicitly MODELS the
correlation between VRE_PRODUCTION and ELECTRICITY_PRICE, based on the
PRODUCTION_COSTS of surrounding GENERATION_CAPACITY. we derive
closed_form expressions for the expected short_term and long_term
revenue, the variance of the revenue and the timing of INVESTMENTS. the
effect of including these SYSTEM_CHARACTERISTICS is illustrated with
NUMERICAL_EXAMPLES, where we find the CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT to decrease
projected profit relative to INVESTMENT_COST from 33% to between 13% and
40%, depending on the assumption for the
FUTURE_VRE_CAPACITY_EXPANSION_RATE. using a REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK, the
INVESTMENT_THRESHOLD_INCREASES by between 13% and 67%, due to the
inclusion of cannibalization.  2023

Title: estimating INCENTIVE_CONTRACTS for SOLAR_PV based MICROGRID_PRODUCTION
considering COST benefit UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
the SOLAR pv_based MICROGRID, as a NEW_MODE of PRODUCTION and consumption
of CLEAN_ENERGY, backs up the variability of RENEWABLES and has
IMPORTANT_IMPLICATIONS for mitigating GLOBAL_CLIMATE change. however, its
further development is limited because of the HIGH_COST and UNCERTAINTY,
which discourages its OPERATORS_INVESTMENT_WILLINGNESS. to guide
CAPITAL_INVESTMENT in MICROGRIDS, we construct a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL to
investigate the FLEXIBLE_INVESTMENT of operators and the
OPTIMAL_INCENTIVE_CONTRACT under UNCERTAINTY. the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD can
more accurately measure the value of REAL_ASSETS in an
UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT, and help decision_makers to
ASSESS_INVESTMENT_COSTS and benefits. moreover, a DEMONSTRATION_PROJECT
in hefei, CHINA is provided as a CASE_STUDY to analyze the impact of the
peak_valley price rates and COST_CHANGES on the INCENTIVE_CONTRACT. the
results demonstrate that subsidies are still necessary to accelerate the
development of SOLAR pv_based MICROGRIDS. however, subsidies in hefei can
be stopped until the INVESTMENT_COST_DROPS to 6101.25 rmb/kw. alleviating
the COST_PRESSURE on operators can stimulate them to adopt the SOLAR
pv_based MICROGRID, but RAPID_COST_REDUCTIONS and fluctuations could
hinder its development. we further uncover that raising the peak_valley
price rate can help to reduce the GOVERNMENT's FINANCIAL_BURDEN caused by
subsidies.  2022, hard publishing company. all rights reserved.
