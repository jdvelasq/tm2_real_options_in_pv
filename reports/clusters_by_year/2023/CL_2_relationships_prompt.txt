Title: DECISION_MAKING on INVESTMENTS in PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS
based on RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard: perspective of REAL_OPTION
Abstract:
```
it is now a MAIN_GLOBAL_TREND to replace the RENEWABLE_ENERGY feed_in
tariffs (fit) policy with the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO_SYSTEM (rps) policy in
the reform of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POLICY_SYSTEMS. to solve the
PRACTICAL_PROBLEM that the CURRENT_MAIN_STUDIES on the DECISION_MAKING
about INVESTMENTS by RENEWABLE_ENERGY_ENTERPRISES mainly focus on
MACROECONOMIC_ASPECTS such as GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDIES, RENEWABLE_ENERGY fit
and CARBON_TAXES, rather than MICROECONOMIC_ASPECTS such as rps and the
tgc MARKET's influence, a REAL_OPTION_MODEL about
PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS is established to study these
projects' SEQUENTIAL_DECISION_MAKING about
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITY, optimal INSTALLED_CAPACITY and phased
INVESTMENT. the RESULT_SHOWS that phased INVESTMENT_FRUIT in much higher
INVESTMENT_FLEXIBILITY, longer ECONOMIC_LIVES and greater PROJECT_VALUES,
and fewer RISKS for investors as well; lower TECHNICAL_COSTS and higher
TGC_PRICES help acquire the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITIES. the
conclusions of this study help make better DECISION_MAKING about
INVESTMENTS in PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS and, from the
MICROCOSMIC_ASPECT, prove influence of the RPS_POLICY.  2022 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_VALUATION with
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_TRINOMIAL_LATTICE REAL_OPTION_MODEL
Abstract:
```
under the uncertain and the FLEXIBILITY required conditions, the
CONVENTIONAL_CAPITAL budgeting techniques are insufficient to decide the
most FEASIBLE_INVESTMENT due to their STATIC_NATURE.
CLASSICAL_REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_TECHNIQUES have been used for
VARIOUS_INVESTMENT_OPTIONS such as deferment and abandonment. although
these techniques help to evaluate the projects in UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTS,
they still follow the static, CERTAIN_BOOLEAN_LOGIC_ASSUMPTIONS.
therefore, further improvement in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION has been
introduced with the usage of FUZZY_LOGIC. FUZZY_LOGIC is applied by
binomial and black_scholes REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_METHODS up to date, but
not with the TRINOMIAL_LATTICE. moreover, types_1 and 2 FUZZY_NUMBERS are
used; however, the INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS are not analyzed in
detail in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION. in this ARTICLE, we propose an
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_TRINOMIAL_LATTICE REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_MODEL for a
SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECT. while valuing the DEFERMENT_OPTION,
EXPERT_OPINIONS, two DIFFERENT_VOLATILITY_METHODS, and a tailor_made
ELECTRICITY price_forecasting model are used. according to our results,
the DEFERMENT_OPTION is valuable and delaying the start of the project
provides a much higher expanded net PRESENT_VALUE than an
IMMEDIATE_START. the contribution of this ARTICLE is that the UNCERTAINTY
in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION is modeled from a BROADER_PERSPECTIVE with
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS by taking the hesitancy of the
decision_maker and the MARKET into account. consequently, the proposed
method would increase the accuracy of the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION in
UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTS such as RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SECTOR.   1988_2012 ieee.

Title: the use of REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_LITERATURE: a
COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW
Abstract:
```
in response to an increasingly COMPETITIVE_ELECTRICITY_MARKET, with
PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) TECHNOLOGY_COSTS rapidly decreasing and governments
incentivizing the development of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION_PROJECTS, a
growing number of ACADEMIC_PAPERS have employed the REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH
(ROA) to planning and evaluating SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS under
MULTIPLE_UNCERTAINTIES and with integrated FLEXIBILITY. this paper
comprehensively reviews the use of ROA in the PV_LITERATURE. it
identifies the most COMMON_TYPES of REAL_OPTIONS, the
MAIN_UNCERTAINTY_SOURCES with their TYPICAL_MATHEMATICAL MODELING, and
the most commonly used OPTION_VALUATION_METHODS. in addition, the 92
papers reviewed are classified into 11 categories according to their area
of application: behavior of PV_PROJECTS under VARIOUS_MARKET_CONDITIONS,
such as subsidies, CLIMATE_CHANGE initiatives, TARIFF_SCHEMES, and
TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS_SCENARIOS (37%), PV_PROJECTS with
OPERATIONAL_FLEXIBILITY (12%), PV_SYSTEMS coupled with
ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS (12%), EVALUATION of PUBLIC_POLICIES (7%), and
DESIGN of POWER_GENERATION_PORTFOLIOS (7%), among others. the results of
this RESEARCH provide an overview of the CURRENT_STATE of ROA in the
EVALUATION of PV_PROJECTS, providing researchers, investors, and
policymakers with IMPORTANT_INSIGHTS into the impact of
DIFFERENT_POLICIES and MARKET_CONDITIONS on PV_PROJECTS and their
INVESTMENT_TIMING.  2023 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to assessing the COST_SAVINGS_POTENTIAL of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_ADOPTION among smes in GHANA
Abstract:
```
small and MEDIUM_SCALE_ENTERPRISES (smes) are integral to
ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT. however, they face significant challenges within
their operations, of which access to an AFFORDABLE_POWER supply is
profound. self_generation options have the potential to curtail these
challenges to an extent, but SMES_NEED to choose options that provide
SIGNIFICANT_COST_SAVINGS. this study proposes a simulation_based
REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL using SECONDARY_DATA to evaluate the
COST_SAVINGS_POTENTIAL for smes in switching from CONVENTIONAL_POWER
generating sources to RENEWABLE_ENERGY based on three MAIN_SCENARIOS:
using RENEWABLE_ENERGY as a backup; a COMPLETE_TRANSITION to
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION; and a PARTIAL_TRANSITION to
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. the results show that using RENEWABLE_ENERGY as
BACKUP_SOURCES of ENERGY does not provide SIGNIFICANT_COST_SAVINGS to the
sme. however, a complete or a PARTIAL_TRANSITION from conventional to
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES offers SUBSTANTIAL_COST_SAVINGS for the sme
over the life of the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGY. smes must consider
CAPACITY_FACTORS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, tariffs for
CONVENTIONAL_POWER supply, SYSTEM_RELIABILITY of CONVENTIONAL_SYSTEMS,
and the INVESTMENT_COSTS for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION as critical
determining factors for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS.
SUCCESSFUL_INTEGRATION of RENEWABLE_ENERGY by smes also requires
POLICY_SUPPORT towards educating smes on its importance and
TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS. KEY_POLICY_INSIGHTS RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INTEGRATION
can allow smes to make SUBSTANTIAL_SAVINGS in their
POWER_CONSUMPTION_COSTS. smes must be mindful of an approach towards
investing in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES so that it also maximises
their gains in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INTEGRATION. GOVERNMENT_POLICY must focus
on creating an enabling environment for smes to reap the benefits of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INTEGRATION.  2022 INFORMA_UK limited, trading as taylor

Title: rethinking the EVALUATION of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS under
YIELDCO_MODE: a REAL_OPTION_PERSPECTIVE
Abstract:
```
many CORPORATIONS_INVEST in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) projects to
MITIGATE_CLIMATE change. however, lack of CAPITAL_POSES a GREAT_CHALLENGE
to the development of the SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY. yieldcos that are a
FINANCIAL_TOOL to SECURITIZE_ASSESTS for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CORPORATIONS
were introduced to alleviate the FINANCIAL_PRESSURE, but their
achievements are unable to meet the expected PERFORMANCE_LEVEL.
therefore, a QUESTION_ARAISES: can yieldcos promote the development of
SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY? to solve this issue, this paper utilized a
REAL_OPTION_METHOD to investigate whether yieldcos can facilitate the
deployment of SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS and their impact on decision_making
processes. based on the solution obtained from the REAL_OPTION_MODEL, we
explore the impacts of DECISIVE_FACTORS on the DEFER_OPTION_VALUE,
INVESTMENT_THRESHOLD and expected EXECUTION_TIME. the JOINT_IMPACTS of
the DIVIDEND_RATIO and other factors are also investigated. we conclude
that yieldcos are suitable for SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS, while a
HIGH_DIVIDEND_RATIO will make INVESTORS_POSTPONE their INVESTMENTS. in
addition, by using the TECHNOLOGICAL_LEVEL to represent the DRIFT_TERM of
INVESTMENT, we further discuss how decision_makers should react to the
POTENTIAL_TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION. moreover, we also discuss the impacts
of potential declines in feed_in tariffs on INVESTORS_BEHAVIOUR. we
conclude that yieldcos can promote the development of SOLAR_PV in CHINA
as it can URGE_INVESTORS to invest at an EARLY_STAGE. related
POLICY_RECOMMENDATIONS are also proposed.  2023 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECT_INVESTMENT based on the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD: an
analysis of the east CHINA_POWER_GRID_REGION
Abstract:
```
DISTRIBUTED_PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV) play a KEY_ROLE in the ENERGY_TRANSITION.
we construct an INVESTMENT_VALUE and TIMING_ASSESSMENT_MODEL based on the
REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD to improve scientific decision_making in distributed
PV investing in an UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT. the model is applied to
ANALYZE_PROJECTS in the east CHINA_POWER_GRID_REGION under multiple
self_consumption ratio scenarios. the results show that investing in
distributed PV_PROJECTS is beneficial, but there are differences in the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING under different self_consumption ratios.
