Title: valuing INVESTMENTS in domestic PV BATTERY_SYSTEMS under UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES are expected to play a MAJOR_ROLE in
mitigating CLIMATE_CHANGE and RESOURCE_DEPLETION effects as well as in
contributing to DOMESTIC_ENERGY_SECURITY. due to the INTERMITTENT_NATURE
of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV), there are often SIGNIFICANT_GAPS between
ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and ENERGY supply by PV_PLANTS. this makes
STORAGE_SYSTEMS a POTENTIAL_OPTION to MAXIMIZE_SAVINGS and
ACCRUE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY by increasing the share of self_consumed
ENERGY while guaranteeing ADEQUATE_POWER_LEVELS in DISTRIBUTION_GRIDS.
this paper provides a THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK to MODEL_HOUSEHOLDS_DECISION
to invest in DOMESTIC_PV_PLANTS coupled with BATTERY_STORAGE. to capture
the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY relative to the decision to install
both a PV_PLANT and a battery, i.e., a domestic pv_battery system (pvb),
we implement a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH and propose an OPTIMIZATION_MODEL,
which we calibrate and test according to data from the
ITALIAN_ENERGY_MARKET. our findings show that the option of storing
ENERGY via BATTERIES_INCREASES de facto INVESTMENT_VALUE: the adoption of
a PVB_INCREASES_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, as HOUSEHOLDS can optimally
exercise the option to decide their consumption and
STORAGE_PATTERNS_CONTINGENT on FAVORABLE_MARKET_CONDITIONS. the
opportunity to STORE_ENERGY via BATTERIES_ENCOURAGES_HOUSEHOLDS to invest
in larger plants compared to those not paired with BATTERIES. there is
indeed a POSITIVE_RELATIONSHIP between the PVB_OPTIMAL_SIZE and
INVESTMENT_TIMING.  2021 elsevier b.v.

Title: VALUATION of compound REAL_OPTIONS for co INVESTMENT in
RESIDENTIAL_BATTERY_SYSTEMS
Abstract:
```
the process of evaluating INVESTMENTS by ELECTRICITY_UTILITIES to
subsidize RESIDENTIAL_BATTERY_INSTALLATIONS in DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS is
challenging, because finding
EFFICIENT_INVESTMENT_PLANS_INVOLVES_REASONING over VARIOUS_SOURCES of
UNCERTAINTY and consideration of different sizing, location and
TIMING_OPTIONS. this work proposes a NOVEL_FINANCIAL_FRAMEWORK using
REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION (ROV) to solve the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PROBLEM for
subsidizing RESIDENTIAL_BATTERY_INSTALLATIONS, considering
COMPOUND_OPTIONS including the option to delay the INVESTMENT and its
SUBSEQUENT_OPTION (expand). we INCORPORATE_RANDOM_VARIATIONS in
PV_GENERATION and LOAD_BEHAVIOUR, making use of MONTE_CARLO (mc)
POWER_FLOW_ANALYSIS that INCORPORATES_BATTERY_SCHEDULING_PROFILES.
specifically, the ROV_FRAMEWORK_SOLVES_STOCHASTIC_POWER_FLOW_ANALYSIS
with BATTERY_SCHEDULING in a forward_looking MC_MODEL, and determines the
OPTIMAL_PLAN for executing the options that maximize the INVESTMENT_VALUE
using BACKWARD_INDUCTION over all MC_PATHS. however, this approach to mc
becomes computationally prohibitive when BATTERY_OPERATIONAL_PROFILES are
generated by optimization_based home ENERGY_MANAGEMENT. to reduce the
COMPUTATIONAL_BURDEN, we use POLICY_FUNCTION_APPROXIMATION to provide
FAST_BATTERY_OPERATIONAL_PROFILES, drawing on MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS
that reduce MC_COMPUTATION_TIME by 95%. compared to
STANDARD_FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS, the proposed model allows ROV to capture all
uncertainties while allowing utilities to make CONTINGENT_DECISIONS to
maximize the benefits from subsidizing RESIDENTIAL_BATTERY_STORAGE.  2022

Title: an AGENT_BASED DIFFUSION_MODEL for RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_DEPLOYMENT in
SINGAPORE: perspective of CONSUMERS_BEHAVIOUR
Abstract:
```
RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC (rpv) is designed for RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS to
GENERATE_ELECTRICITY from SOLAR_ENERGY. despite
VARIOUS_GOVERNMENT_REGULATIONS to boost PV_DEPLOYMENT, RPV_DIFFUSION in
SINGAPORE has been slow, accounting for less than 4% of installed
PV_CAPACITY by 2021. INVESTMENT_VOLATILITY and
UNCERTAINTY_IMPEDE_RPV_DEPLOYMENT as it significantly AFFECTS_CONSUMERS'
ADOPTION_DECISIONS. RPV_DIFFUSION_ANALYSIS helps researchers develop
DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGIES by considering and modelling the
RPV_DIFFUSION_PROCESS and its major influencing factors. however, the
existing WORKS_NEGLECT_HETEROGENOUS_CONSUMERS' behaviours to
ADDRESS_INVESTMENT_VOLATILITY in the network. CONSUMER_BEHAVIOURS,
including SPONTANEOUS_ADOPTION_DECISIONS and
INTERPERSONAL_COMMUNICATIONS, are essential in determining RPV_ADOPTION
and DIFFUSION. this study constructed a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS supported
agent_based DIFFUSION_MODEL (roa_abdm) to investigate the RPV_DIFFUSION
in SINGAPORE by applying the bottom_up SIMULATION modelling approach. ROA
is used in SIMULATION based RPV_DIFFUSION_ANALYSIS to offer consumers
FLEXIBLE_OPTIONS to ADDRESS_INVESTMENT_VOLATILITY by calculating the
option's value. afterward, the agent_based DIFFUSION_MODEL is developed,
calibrated, and validated with rpv HISTORICAL_DIFFUSION_DATA in
SINGAPORE. from the what_if analysis using the developed model, this
STUDY_IDENTIFIES that the OPTIMAL_RPV_SUBSIDY_INTENSITY is 3040% and
reveals that RPV_DIFFUSION is more effective in a tight_knit network and
sensitive to INVESTMENT_VOLATILITY. based on the findings, this study
proposes two POLICY_SUGGESTIONS, including stage_based DYNAMIC_POLICY and
trusted_network oriented campaigns. this STUDY_CONTRIBUTES to the body of
knowledge by integrating ROA_ANALYSIS into agent_based modelling for the
RPV_DIFFUSION_ANALYSIS, and the proposed model can be extended to analyse
other RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in DIFFERENT_GEOGRAPHIC_REGIONS.

Title: what are you waiting to invest in grid connected
RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAICS in california? a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
Abstract:
```
the purpose of this paper is to assess the OPTIMAL_CHOICE of an investor,
a TYPICAL_HOUSEHOLD in california, UNITED_STATES, in terms of whether to
invest or not, in a RESIDENTIAL_SCALE, grid_connected,
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM, aiming to obtain SAVINGS in their
MONTHLY_ELECTRIC_EXPENSES. if they invest, they shoulder a fixed
UPFRONT_COST but also accept UNCERTAIN_POTENTIAL_SAVINGS. if they do not
invest, they forego any POTENTIAL_SAVINGS. to assess this
IRREVERSIBLE_DECISION, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS is deployed to assess the
ACTUAL_BENEFIT for the HOUSEHOLD. this approach allows us to determine
whether to trigger the INVESTMENTS and the OPTIMAL_TIMING to do so. our
findings show it is optimal for our investor to invest in PHOTOVOLTAICS;
however, some delay might be advised depending on the
ENERGY_PRODUCTION_FACTOR of SPECIFIC_GEOGRAPHICAL_AREAS and the expected
USEFUL_LIFE of the EQUIPMENT. the results of this study also show that it
might be optimal to delay the INVESTMENT between 5.5 and 12 YEARS in some
areas, which is a drawback. our findings also show that subsidies and
other incentives do not seem to be a KEY_DRIVER in the above_mentioned
INVESTMENT_DECISION. this STUDY_CONTRIBUTES to the existing literature by
examining the present dynamic of residential grid_connected
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS in the most RELEVANT_MARKET for the UNITED_STATES
and by including an assessment of UNCERTAINTY in both ELECTRIC_RATES and
PHOTOVOLTAICS_PRICES, that accounts for seasonality, PRICE_ESCALATION and
PRICE_MANIPULATION.  2021 INFORMA_UK limited, trading as taylor &

Title: economic and FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS of a grid connected PV_SYSTEM in rio de
janeiro for residential and commercial supply
Abstract:
```
SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT and RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES are topics that have
attracted GLOBAL_ATTENTION together with greater awareness of the need to
preserve the planet's NATURAL_RESOURCES while still supplying
ENERGY_DEMAND. this paper presents an economic and FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS of
a PV grid_connected system for residential and commercial supply located
in the state of rio de janeiro. the model is evaluated considering
TECHNICAL_ASPECTS like ENERGY_SECURITY, compatibility,
ENERGY_PRODUCTION_OPTIMISATION and ECONOMIC_PAYBACK forecasting where the
REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY (rot) is applied for ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS. the
ECONOMIC_VIABILITY and the TECHNICAL_POTENTIAL of a grid_connected system
rated at 2.7 kwp and 11.7 KWP_PV for residential and COMMERCIAL_SCALE,
respectively, were examined. demonstrating that for a system expected to
last 25 YEARS, the PAYBACK_TIME_RESULTS occur in six YEARS, minimum, at
RESIDENTIAL_SCALE and five YEARS at COMMERCIAL_SCALE, proving the
INVESTMENT_VIABILITY. copyright  inderscience enterprises ltd.
