Title: REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS of INVESTMENT in SOLAR vs. WIND_ENERGY:
DIVERSIFICATION_STRATEGIES under UNCERTAIN_PRICES and COSTS
Abstract:
```
in this paper we study a community or firm considering to diversify its
INVESTMENT in two distinct RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, namely WIND and
SOLAR_PV_ELECTRICITY. we assume TECHNOLOGICAL_LEARNING_CURVES as a
function of CUMULATIVE_CAPITAL_INVESTMENT. a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH is
applied as it takes into ACCOUNT_UNCERTAINTY about prices and learning,
as well as IRREVERSIBILITY associated with INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. we
investigate three DIFFERENT_CASES, dealing with UNCERTAINTY about
FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES, and UNCERTAINTY about the speed with which
learning drives the COSTS of WIND and SOLAR_ELECTRICITY down. we assess
the MINIMUM_THRESHOLD for the STOCHASTIC_PRICE and the
MAXIMUM_ELECTRICITY_PRODUCTION_COST that makes it optimal for the firm to
invest in the two technologies. the results show that the
LEARNING_RATE_AFFECTS the option to invest in but reducing
CRITICAL_THRESHOLD for exercising it. the greater the amount of CAPITAL
invested, the more LEARNING_STIMULATES earlier exercising of the option
to invest. the firm will then anticipate the option to invest and
exercise it for lower CRITICAL_THRESHOLD_VALUES if all CAPITAL is
invested in one TECHNOLOGY. if CAPITAL_INVESTMENT is diversified, the
option should be exercised at a higher CRITICAL_THRESHOLD. more
UNCERTAINTY in ENERGY_PRICES or TECHNOLOGY_COSTS_POSTPONES the option to
invest. although investing in both SOLAR and WIND may be profitable under
PARTICULAR_CONDITIONS of price and COST_UNCERTAINTY, the theoretically
OPTIMAL_STRATEGY is generally investing in only one TECHNOLOGY, that is,
SOLAR or WIND, depending on their RELATIVE_INITIAL_COSTS and
LEARNING_RATES. this suggests that the practice in most countries of
diversifying RENEWABLE_ENERGY may reflect a MISTAKEN_STRATEGY.  2017

Title: diversified ENERGY_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES based on REAL_OPTIONS:
HYDROPOWER vs. SOLAR_POWER
Abstract:
```
based on REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH (ROA), this paper presents a diversified
INVESTMENT_STRATEGY, that is, a company invests in two distinct
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES (SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) and hydro).
assumed that the LEARNING_CURVE of PV_TECHNOLOGY is a function of
CUMULATIVE_CAPITAL_INVESTMENT, the COST of HYDROPOWER_INVESTMENT is
constant. under the UNCERTAIN_CONDITIONS of FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICE,
LEARNING_RATE and INITIAL_COST, we use ROA to evaluate the
MINIMUM_THRESHOLD of STOCHASTIC_ELECTRICITY_PRICE when the
COMPANYS_INVESTMENT in these two technologies is optimal. the more
CAPITAL invested, the more LEARNING_RATE can stimulate the early exercise
of INVESTMENT_OPTIONS. however, if all the CAPITAL is invested in
PV_TECHNOLOGY, the company will predict the INVESTMENT_OPTION and
exercise it at a lower threshold. if CAPITAL_INVESTMENT is diversified,
options will be exercised at a higher threshold. when all CAPITAL is
invested in HYDROPOWER, the CRITICAL_THRESHOLD is the highest. this is
because HYDROPOWER_TECHNOLOGY_TENDS to be mature or even outdated, and it
is difficult to reduce the COST according to the existing
TECHNOLOGY_LEVEL. more UNCERTAINTY about
ELECTRICITY_PRICES_DELAYS_INVESTMENT_CHOICES. although INVESTMENT in
SOLAR_ENERGY and HYDROPOWER may be profitable under
CERTAIN_PRICE_UNCERTAINTIES, the best strategy in theory is usually to
invest in only one TECHNOLOGY, namely SOLAR_ENERGY. this suggests that in
most countries, the diversification of RENEWABLE_ENERGY may reflect a
WRONG_STRATEGY. copyrightworld ACADEMIC_PRESS, world ACADEMIC_UNION.

Title: EVALUATION of certified EMISSION_REDUCTIONS in POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT
through REAL_OPTIONS;
Abstract:
```
this ARTICLE_EVALUATES a POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT from SOLAR_SOURCE in
COLOMBIA. it considers the INCENTIVE by certified
EMISSION_REDUCTIONS_SALES. it is evaluated by TRADITIONAL_METHOD and
REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD with the ENERGY_PRICE as an uncertain variable.
initially, the project is not profitable for investors, however, with the
deferment REAL_OPTION the project is profitable as long as the
ENERGY_PRICE takes HIGH_VALUES.  2018, revistaespacios.com.
