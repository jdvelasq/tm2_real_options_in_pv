Title: the economic and ENVIRONMENTAL_VALUES of the r&D_INVESTMENT in a
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SECTOR in SOUTH_KOREA
Abstract:
```
although a fossil_based FUEL_ECONOMY has allowed SOUTH_KOREA to rapidly
develop, the ECONOMIC_GROWTH means that SOUTH_KOREA is now one of the
largest sources of CARBON_EMISSIONS. the south KOREAN_GOVERNMENT has
recently made a RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PLAN to convert the economy
based on FOSSIL_FUELS to an economy based on RENEWABLE_ENERGY. in order
to analyze the ECONOMIC_FEASIBILITY of the RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT (r&d)
INVESTMENT required for this change, this STUDY_EVALUATES the
r&D_INVESTMENT in the six types of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES  biomass
ENERGY, WASTE_ENERGY, PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY, SOLAR_THERMAL_ENERGY,
MARINE_ENERGY, and WIND POWER_ENERGY, while considering several
UNCERTAINTY_FACTORS  a RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION amount, an
r&D_INVESTMENT amount, a UNIT_PRICE, and a risk_free INTEREST_RATE. this
STUDY_UTILIZES the SYSTEM_DYNAMICS_APPROACH using the black_scholes model
and CONDUCTS_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSES of the UNCERTAINTY_FACTORS. the results
indicate that the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION amount has a relatively
LARGE_INFLUENCE on both the r&D_INVESTMENT_VALUE and the
CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION amount. in the MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION, a
risk_free INTEREST_RATE has annually a SMALL_IMPACT on the
r&D_INVESTMENT_VALUE.  2018 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS of a RESIDENTIAL_PV_SYSTEM from the TIMING_PERSPECTIVE:
a REAL_OPTION_MODEL
Abstract:
```
this paper proposes a NEW_MODEL for determining OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME
for RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_SYSTEMS. the model explicitly
incorporates the COST_UNCERTAINTY of the PV_SYSTEM and a RESIDENT's
option to DEFER_INVESTMENT, using a REAL_OPTION_MODEL. the paper provides
THEORETICAL_ANALYSIS as well as CASE_STUDIES. using the
REAL_OPTION_MODEL, we show that the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_THRESHOLD_DECREASES in case of VOLATILITY_INCREASE,
mean_drift decrease and benefit decrease. a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS using
DIFFERENT_PV_SIZES_ILLUSTRATES that the optimal waiting time for
SUBSTANTIAL_PV_DIFFUSION to smaller PV_SYSTEMS is longer than that of
larger systems. the paper also investigates the expected INVESTMENT_TIMES
in the UNITED_STATES, GERMANY, JAPAN, and KOREA and shows that all
countries except GERMANY_NEED to wait to invest. moreover, a
COMPARISON_STUDY to the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) METHOD_DEMONSTRATES that
PV_SYSTEM_INVESTMENT can be additionally delayed by 5.7611.01 YEARS.
