Title: a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT with application to
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA
Abstract:
```
this paper proposes a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for evaluating
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT by considering UNCERTAIN_FACTORS such as
CO2_PRICE, non_renewable ENERGY COST, INVESTMENT_COST and MARKET_PRICE of
ELECTRICITY. a phase_out mechanism is built into the model to reflect the
long_term changes of SUBSIDY_POLICY. we apply the proposed model to
empirically evaluate the INVESTMENT_VALUE and OPTIMAL_TIMING for
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA. our EMPIRICAL_RESULTS show
that the CURRENT_INVESTMENT_ENVIRONMENT in CHINA may not be able to
attract IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT, while the development of CARBON_MARKET
helps advance the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME. a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS is
conducted to investigate the dynamics of INVESTMENT_VALUE and
OPTIMAL_TIMING under the changes of unit generating capacity,
SUBSIDY_LEVEL, MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, CO2_PRICE and
INVESTMENT_COST. it is found that the HIGH_INVESTMENT_COST and the
VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY and CO2_PRICES, are not conducive to attract
IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT. instead, increasing the level of SUBSIDY, promoting
TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and maintaining the stability of MARKET are useful
to STIMULATE_INVESTMENT.  2016 elsevier b.v.

Title: optimal FEED_IN_TARIFF for SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA:
a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
Abstract:
```
the feed_in tariff policy is widely used to promote the development of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY. CHINA also adopts feed_in tariff policy to attract
greater INVESTMENT in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION. this study
employs REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD to assess the OPTIMAL_LEVELS of feed_in
tariffs in 30 provinces of CHINA. the uncertainties in CO2_PRICE and
INVESTMENT_COST are considered. a method that integrates the backward
DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING ALGORITHM and least_squares MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is
used to solve the model. the results demonstrate that the feed_in tariffs
of 30 PROVINCES_RANGE from 0.68 rmb/kwh to 1.71 rmb/kwh, and the
AVERAGE_LEVEL is 1.01 rmb/kwh. on this basis, we find that the levels of
sub_regional feed_in tariff announced in 2013 are no longer appropriate
and should be adjusted as soon as possible. we have also identified the
implications of TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and CARBON_EMISSION trading
schemes, as well as the importance of strengthening
ELECTRICITY_TRANSMISSION. it has been suggested that the
CHINESE_GOVERNMENT takes DIVERSE_MEASURES, including increasing RESEARCH
and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT, establishing and improving a
NATIONWIDE_CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme and accelerating the
construction of electricity_transmission infrastructure, to reduce the
required feed_in tariff and promote the development of
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: OPTIMAL_DESIGN of SUBSIDY to stimulate RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS: the
case of CHINA
Abstract:
```
this paper proposes a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for estimating the
OPTIMAL_SUBSIDY for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT by using
STOCHASTIC_PROCESS to describe the MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, co2price
and INVESTMENT_COST. two indicators, i.e., PROJECT_VALUE and
THRESHOLD_VALUE, are used to derive the OPTIMAL_SUBSIDY. the least
SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION_METHOD is used to solve the model. the
proposed model is used to empirically evaluate the OPTIMAL_LEVEL of
SUBSIDY for SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA. the results
show that CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme helps reduce SUBSIDY. unit
generating capacity, MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, co2price and the
VOLATILITY of INVESTMENT_COST are negatively related with SUBSIDY,
WHEREAS_INVESTMENT_COST and the VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY_PRICE and
co2price are positively related with SUBSIDY. it is suggested that
CHINESE_GOVERNMENTS take some measures, e.g., promoting
TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS, establishing a NATIONWIDE_CARBON_EMISSION trading
MARKET, promoting the COMPETITION in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INDUSTRY as well as
maintaining the stability of co2price and ELECTRICITY_PRICE, to reduce
the required SUBSIDY.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: the VALUATION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under
CARBON_MARKET_LINKAGE based on REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
this paper provides a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH to ANALYZE_INVESTMENT_VALUE
for PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under CARBON_MARKET_LINKAGE. the
PRIMARY_PURPOSE is to evaluate PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under
uncertainties from the perspective of POWER_GENERATION_ENTERPRISES.
uncertainties in INVESTMENT_COSTS, ELECTRICITY_PRICES, CARBON_PRICES and
SUBSIDY_PAYMENTS are considered. in addition, the MARKET co_movements of
INVESTMENT_COSTS are considered in this study. DUNHUANG is taken as a
CASE_STUDY to evaluate the value of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION through
SCENARIO_ANALYSIS. the RESULT_SHOWS that the INVESTMENT_VALUE of
PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION is negative. enterprise should give up the
INVESTMENT or DELAY_INVESTMENT until MATURE_CONDITIONS. moreover, the
INVESTMENT_VALUE can be improved by TECHNICAL_IMPROVEMENT, increasing a
CERTAIN_RANGE of SUBSIDY_PAYMENTS, etc. the RESEARCH presented would be
useful for PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT_EVALUATION and related
decision_marking.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: HARD_COAL_PROJECT_VALUATION based on REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH:
multiplicative vs. ARITHMETIC_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS;
Abstract:
```
PRECISE_VALUATION of the ECONOMIC_EFFICIENCY of RISKY_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS
in the MINERAL_SECTOR has a DIRECT_IMPACT on the range of
FUTURE_INVESTMENTS. since the mid_90s, a number of enterprises have also
been giving increased attention to the VALUATION of
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY that cannot normally be estimated with classical
discounted CASH_FLOW (dcf) analysis. this has been the result of a
development in the REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) and the simplification of
its ALGORITHMS, most of which have been achieved through:  incorporating
LATTICE_MODELS,  introducing a single UNCERTAIN_PROJECT_PARAMETER
(GROSS_PRESENT_VALUE, PV) as an underlying instrument,  assuming that the
underlying asset follows the MULTIPLICATIVE_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS,
introducing the marketed ASSET_DISCLAIMER (mad) assumption.
unfortunately, in most cases, MODELS constructed on the abovementioned
assumptions and modifications are not consistent with REAL_PROJECTS. some
analysts recognize that PROJECT_PVS might not follow the
MULTIPLICATIVE_PROCESS, which could have a DIRECT_IMPACT on the
PROJECTS_VALUE. in order to improve the MAD_APPROACH, the paper proposes
a modified model where the MULTIPLICATIVE_TREE is replaced with an
additive one. in addition, methods of ADDITIVE_VOLATILITY_CALCULATION and
DIVIDEND_ADJUSTMENTS were suggested.  2016, POLSKA_AKADEMIA_NAUK. all
