Title: INNOVATION_SUBSIDIES_VERSUS_CONSUMER_SUBSIDIES: a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
of SOLAR_ENERGY
Abstract:
```
given the interest in the commercialization of affordable,
CLEAN_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, we examine the prospects of
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV). we consider the question of how to transition
to a MEANINGFUL_PERCENTAGE of SOLAR_ENERGY in a SUSTAINABLE_MANNER and
which policies are most effective in accelerating adoption. this paper
develops a stochastic DYNAMIC_MODEL of the adoption of SOLAR_PV in the
residential and COMMERCIAL_SECTOR under two sources of UNCERTAINTY _ the
price of ELECTRICITY and COST of SOLAR. the ANALYTIC_RESULTS suggest that
a HIGH_RATE of INNOVATION may DELAY_ADOPTION of a NEW_TECHNOLOGY if the
consumer has RATIONAL_PRICE_EXPECTATIONS. we simulate the model across
ALTERNATIVE_RATES_TECHNOLOGICAL change, ELECTRICITY_PRICES, subsidies and
CARBON_TAXES. it is shown that there will be a displacement of
INCUMBENT_TECHNOLOGIES and a widespread shift towards SOLAR_PV in under
30 YEARS _ and that this can occur without CONSUMER_INCENTIVES and CARBON
PRICING. we show that these policies have a MODEST_IMPACT in accelerating
adoption, and that they may not be an EFFECTIVE_PART of CLIMATE_POLICY.
instead, results demonstrate that further TECHNOLOGICAL_CHANGE is the
CRUCIAL_DETERMINANT and MAIN_DRIVER of adoption. further, results
indicate that subsidies and taxes become increasingly ineffective with
higher rates of TECHNOLOGICAL_CHANGE.  2016.

Title: the paradox effects of UNCERTAINTY and FLEXIBILITY on INVESTMENT in
RENEWABLES under GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT
Abstract:
```
given that companies have the FLEXIBILITY to decide about size and timing
of a RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY_INVESTMENT, the existence of four paradox
effects is proven: only the type but not the amount of
GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT has an influence on the OPTIMAL_CAPACITY of a
RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY GENERATING_SYSTEM. a decrease of
GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT over time may result in higher capacities of
RENEWABLES installed on an INDUSTRY_LEVEL, at least on the SHORT_TERM.
likewise, higher UNCERTAINTY may encourage an expansion of these
capacities. in contrast, TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS may hamper the expansion
of capacities. finally, these four paradox effects are exemplified in a
germany_based CASE_STUDY regarding a PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECT.  2016 elsevier

Title: application of REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION for analysing the impact of
PUBLIC_R&d FINANCING on RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PROJECTS: a COMPANYS_PERSPECTIVE
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_CONTRASTS the FINANCIAL_BENEFIT of grants given to RESEARCH
and DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS with the reduction in MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY
they impose, which implies a loss in the value of the project. to
quantify this loss of value, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS has been adopted as
the most SUITABLE_FRAMEWORK to assess and
QUANTIFY_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY. this idea is illustrated by the case of
a RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_PROJECT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY, specifically
concentrated SOLAR_POWER. our results show that the value added by the
grants is less than the NOMINAL_INCENTIVES received as a result of the
loss of FLEXIBILITY for MANAGERS; they cannot apply CERTAIN_OPTIONS such
as deferral, nor can they abandon the project. therefore, a break_even
grant is proposed that equals the FINANCIAL_INCENTIVE with the loss of
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY. under this break_even point, the grant should be
rejected. this paper will create awareness for both POLICY_MAKERS and
PRIVATE_COMPANIES regarding a more ACCURATE_ASSESSMENT of grants to
RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT FUNDING as well as provide insights to improve
GRANT_SCHEMES without increasing the amount of PUBLIC_FUNDS.  2016

Title: timing RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_INVESTMENTS in the presence of
DEMAND_UNCERTAINTIES
Abstract:
```
as INVESTMENT in RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS is increasing at a
RAPID_PACE, it is important to investigate whether delaying or otherwise
timing these INVESTMENTS can maximize LONG_TERM_INVESTMENT_GAINS.
CONVENTIONAL_FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS_METHODS for evaluating
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS in solar_electric system are all based on a one_time
installation of the PV_SYSTEMS and cannot be applied to analyze the
benefit of delayed and staged INVESTMENT. SUCH_BENEFITS could be
declining COSTS of PV_SYSTEMS thus tempting investors to hold off and
wait for a better moment to invest. this paper proposes a
DECISION_MAKING_FRAMEWORK using the REAL_OPTION_METHOD to analyze the
OPTIMUM_TIME to invest in a RESIDENTIAL_PV_SYSTEM in DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS.
a reference RESIDENTIAL_HOUSE is used to test the effect of
DIFFERENT_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES. the results show the type of staged
INVESTMENT of installing RESIDENTIAL_PV_SYSTEM that maximizes the
long_term payoff. this reveals when the option to DELAY_INVESTMENT is
preferred. the supporting SOURCE_CODE and data are available for download

Title: determining the OPTIMAL_INSTALLATION_TIMING of building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS
Abstract:
```
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS offer CLEAN_ENERGY_PRODUCTION and have the potential
to meet FUTURE_ENERGY_DEMANDS. as a decentralized POWER_SOURCE,
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS_ENHANCE the security of ELECTRICITY_SUPPLIES. one
type of PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS, building integrated PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS,
offer ADDITIONAL_ADVANTAGES beyond TRADITIONAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS as
they do not require LARGE_SWATCHES of land as they are integrated into
existing BUILDINGS. unfortunately, despite these benefits, UNCERTAINTY
regarding FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES make valuing PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS
difficult, which reduces their attractiveness. in scenarios with
UNCERTAINTY in FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES, investors have
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY in the form of deferring INVESTMENT and
considering VARIOUS_SYSTEM_SIZES, which can affect and improve
SYSTEM_VALUATIONS. considering that variation in ELECTRICITY_PRICES can
jeopardize the TIMELY_INSTALLATION of an optimally sized
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM, the objective of this paper is to propose a
REAL_OPTION_FRAMEWORK to model the price of ELECTRICITY and account for
the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY when valuing building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. a CASE_STUDY using the framework is conducted to
calculate the net PRESENT_VALUE of a real_life building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECT in daejeon, SOUTH_KOREA. it was found that the
OPTIMAL_DECISION for would_be building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM_OWNERS is to wait to invest in building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS when there are HIGH_LEVELS of UNCERTAINTY in
FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES. this holds true even if the net PRESENT_VALUES
for systems without options are positive. when applying this strategy to
the apartment complex in the CASE_STUDY, it generated an OPTION_VALUE of
approximately $87,000.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: the effect of current and PROSPECTIVE_POLICIES on
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM_ECONOMICS: an application to the us MIDWEST
Abstract:
```
this STUDY_MODELS FUNDAMENTAL_FEATURES of current and
PROSPECTIVE_POLICIES ENCOURAGING_ADOPTION of RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC
(PV) systems. a key finding is that time_of_day (tod) PRICING can enhance
or worsen the ECONOMICS of PV_SYSTEMS. moreover, increased responsiveness
of ELECTRICITY_DEMAND to its PRICE_DIMINISHES the effectiveness of tod
PRICING in the absence of net metering, but does not affect it otherwise.
an application to PLAUSIBLE_CONDITIONS in the state of INDIANA, usa,
shows that CURRENT_POLICIES are unlikely to TRIGGER_ADOPTION by a
risk_neutral forward_looking RESIDENTIAL_CUSTOMER. however, adoption of
PV_SYSTEMS can be induced if the FEDERAL_TAX_CREDIT is increased to cover
48% of CAPITAL_COST (instead of the current 30%), which could imply a
COST to the FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT of about $0.95/kw of INSTALLED_CAPACITY
depending on the panel's size. we demonstrate that implementation of tod
PRICING can TRIGGER_ADOPTION under a range of on_ and off_peak price
combinations. but our analysis also shows that the cost_effectiveness of
tod PRICING is enhanced at higher ratios of on_peak to off_peak prices.

Title: SOLAR_PV leasing in SINGAPORE: enhancing return on INVESTMENTS with
options
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_ENERGY is getting more IMPORTANT_NOWADAYS as an alternative to
TRADITIONAL_ENERGIES. SOLAR_ENERGY, according to ENERGY_MARKET_AUTHORITY,
is the most viable in the context of SINGAPORE compared to other
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES due to land constraints. in light of the
increasing adoption of SOLAR_POWER in SINGAPORE, this PAPER_FOCUSES on
SOLAR_PV leasing using a CASE_STUDY. this PAPER_ASSESSES the prospect for
SOLAR_PV LEASING_COMPANIES in SINGAPORE through the lens of embedded
REAL_OPTIONS. the RECENT_NEWS that SOLAR_POWER is becoming the
CHEAPEST_FORM of NEW_ELECTRICITY presents the leasing company an option
to expand the scale of SOLAR_PV_SYSTEM. taking into account this option,
the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) of the INVESTMENT increased significantly
compared to the case without REAL_OPTIONS.
TECHNOLOGICAL_DEVELOPMENTS_RESULT in a continuously CHANGING_ENVIRONMENT
with uncertainties. thus, DECISION_MAKERS_NEED to be aware of the
INHERENT_RISK associated and IDENTIFY_OPTIONS to MAXIMIZE_NPV. this
UPSIDE_POTENTIAL is realized by exercising the MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY and
exploiting the UNCERTAINTY. the paper enables SOLAR_ENERGY_PLANNERS to
consider POSSIBLE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITIES under uncertainties, showing
how option thinking can be incorporated in the VALUATION of SOLAR_ENERGY.

Title: ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS of ELECTRICITY_STORAGE based on HEAT_PUMPS and
THERMAL_STORAGE_UNITS in LARGE_SCALE thermal POWER_PLANTS
Abstract:
```
in this paper the FINANCIAL_VIABILITY of a NOVEL_STORAGE_CONCEPT,
referred to as 'integrated pumped_heat_electricity storage', is assessed
for both a coal_fired and a combined cycle (cc) POWER_PLANT located in
GERMANY, as well as for a concentrated SOLAR_POWER (csp) plant located in
spain. the rationale of this concept is to use ELECTRICITY during times
of CHEAP_WHOLESALE_MARKET_PRICES, e.g. stemming from a high supply of
RENEWABLE_ENERGIES, in order to GENERATE_THERMAL_ENERGY via a HEAT_PUMP,
since THERMAL_ENERGY can be stored at comparatively low COST. if the
ELECTRICITY_DEMAND_RISES again, the stored THERMAL_ENERGY is used to
power a conventional water_steam cycle, thereby reducing the amount of
FOSSIL_FUELS used or enlarging the operating time of a CSP_PLANT. a mixed
INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAM, considering the day_ahead
WHOLESALE_MARKET_ELECTRICITY_PRICES and remunerations of
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER in GERMANY, is employed to find an
approximation of the OPTIMAL_SCHEDULE for the generation in the
POWER_PLANT as well as for the purchase and the sale of ELECTRICITY. the
FINANCIAL_VIABILITY is assessed using net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) and
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS. storing ELECTRICITY to profit from
TEMPORAL_ARBITRAGE is found to be unprofitable, since the (conservatively
estimated) COSTS of THERMAL_STORAGE_UNITS are still too high. the largest
part of the revenues stems from the remunerations of
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER. therefore, while the utilization of
HEAT_PUMPS, which are estimated to have rather HIGH_COSTS, is not
profitable, employing ELECTRIC_HEATERS without STORAGE_UNITS is found to
be economically viable for a coal_fired and a CC_POWER_PLANT in GERMANY.
here, NPV and REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS_YIELD the same result, i.e. to invest
immediately in such an application. in spain,
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER is presently not remunerated, but only
the call_offs of TERTIARY_CONTROL_ENERGY, which are not considered in the
mixed INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAM. consequently, employing ELECTRIC_HEATERS in
CSP_PLANTS in spain is found to be not financially viable either.  2017

in the ACTUAL_CONTEXT in which COMMERCIAL_INDUSTRIES_NEED to achieve
greater competitiveness through their processes, efficiency is required
in the MANAGEMENT of ELECTRICITY. COMMERCIAL_BUILDINGS_NEED_SOLUTIONS
that are adequate to their environment and that would mean

are required for allowing EVALUATION of ALTERNATIVE_SOURCES for
generation, taking into account both the res and
METHODS_CHARACTERISTIC_UNCERTAINTIES, which are involved in the process
of TECHNOLOGY_SELECTION. this paper proposes a HYBRID_METHOD composed by
technics of ANALYTIC_HIERARCHY_PROCESS (ahp), the technique for
ORDER_PREFERENCE by similarity to IDEAL_SOLUTION (topsis), the theory
REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS (ROA), the MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION (mcs), and the
BINOMIAL_METHOD (bm), to select the most ADEQUATE_TECHNOLOGIES for
ELECTRICITY self_generation in shopping centers (scs); it takes into

Abstract:
```
PRIVATE_HOME_OWNERS are free to invest in ENERGY EFFICIENT_REFURBISHMENTS
of their building at any time. besides, they can
INSTALL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS, HEAT_PUMPS and other EQUIPMENT at will.
although the consequences for DISTRIBUTION_GRIDS can be significant, most
studies about the FUTURE supply task still utilize fixed ANNUAL_RATES of
refurbishment and scenarios for the installation of distributed
ENERGY_RESOURCES (der). while highly ECONOMICAL_INVESTMENTS are usually
undertaken, a lot of UNCERTAINTY remains for PRIVATE_INVESTORS. in this
study, the effect of SUCH_UNCERTAINTIES is modelled in terms of a highly
FLEXIBLE_REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION that focuses on the option to defer an
INVESTMENT. it is therefore assumed that the expected value of most
INVESTMENTS is high while a SIGNIFICANT_AMOUNT of RISK has to be dealt
with. HISTORIC_DATA of refurbishment and MARKET_SITUATION is used to
