Title: lobatto milstein NUMERICAL_METHOD in application of
UNCERTAINTY_INVESTMENT of SOLAR_POWER_PROJECTS
Abstract:
```
recently, there has been a growing interest in the PRODUCTION of
ELECTRICITY from RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES (res). the RES_INVESTMENT is
characterized by UNCERTAINTY, which is long_term, costly and depends on
feed_in tariff and SUPPORT_SCHEMES. in this paper, we address the
REAL_OPTION_VALUATION (ROV) of a SOLAR_POWER_PLANT_INVESTMENT. the
REAL_OPTION_FRAMEWORK is investigated. this FRAMEWORK_CONSIDERS the
RENEWABLE_CERTIFICATE_PRICE and, further, the COST of delay between
establishing and operating the SOLAR_POWER_PLANT. the OPTIMAL_TIME of
launching the project and assessing the value of the DEFERRED_OPTION are
discussed. the new three_stage NUMERICAL_METHODS are constructed, the
lobatto3c_milstein (l3cm) methods. the NUMERICAL_METHODS are integrated
with the concept of black_scholes option PRICING theory and applied in
OPTION_VALUATION for SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT with UNCERTAINTY. the
NUMERICAL_RESULTS of the l3cm, FINITE_DIFFERENCE and MONTE_CARLO_METHODS
are compared to show the efficiency of our methods. our DATASET_REFERS to

Title: DEFER_OPTION_VALUATION and OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING of
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS under DIFFERENT_ELECTRICITY_MARKET_SYSTEMS
and SUPPORT_SCHEMES
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_APPLIES the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD to analyse the
DEFER_OPTION_VALUE and OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING for
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS in CHINA. the MAIN_PURPOSE of this paper is
to examine INVESTMENT_BEHAVIOURS under DIFFERENT_MARKET_SYSTEMS and
SUPPORT_SCHEMES. this paper further investigates the interaction of
TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and SUPPORT_SCHEMES. four scenarios are designed,
and the CORRESPONDING_REAL_OPTIONS_MODELS are established. in the
CASE_STUDY, we find that ELECTRICITY_MARKET_REFORM_ENHANCES the
DEFER_OPTION_VALUE in the SHORT_TERM but makes the owners of
SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS_POSTPONE their INVESTMENT. nevertheless, the GOVERNMENT
can STIMULATE_INVESTMENT by implementing APPROPRIATE_SUPPORT_SCHEMES.
additionally, the impacts of DIFFERENT_SUPPORT_SCHEMES vary according to
the MARKET_SYSTEM. the impacts of feed_in tariffs and PRICE_PREMIUMS are
similar in a regulated MARKET but are different in a FREE_MARKET. the
PRICE_PREMIUM_SCHEME greatly promotes the DEFER_OPTION_VALUES in the
SHORT_TERM, but the feed_in tariff scheme excels in the LONG_TERM. a
feed_in tariff has a greater impact on reducing the expected
EXECUTION_TIME and its variance than the PRICE_PREMIUM. in addition, more
ATTRACTIVE_SUPPORT_SCHEMES are required when the TECHNOLOGICAL_LEVEL is
improved.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD
