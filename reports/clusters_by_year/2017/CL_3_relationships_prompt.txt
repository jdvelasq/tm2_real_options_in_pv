Title: impact of FLEXIBILITY in PUBLIC_R&d FUNDING: how REAL_OPTIONS could avoid
the CROWDING_OUT effect
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_EXPLORES NEW_MECHANISMS to ENSURE_GRANTS are additional to
PRIVATE_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT with no displacing or
crowding_out effect. our results indicate that by studying the
FLEXIBILITY embedded in these type of projects, using the
REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK, it is possible to reduce the size of grants given
by FINANCING bodies while remaining equally attractive to companies. this
result is reached due to the higher FLEXIBILITY provided in potential
NEW_GRANT_SCHEMES. in addition to the OBVIOUS_CONSEQUENCE of less
EXPENSIVE_PUBLIC_R&d FUNDING, there are other SIDE_BENEFITS to this
NEW_SCHEME, such as avoiding the crowding_out effect while also allowing
more honest and SINCERE_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT by companies
because they are sharing the RISK with the FUNDING body. this paper
presents a CASE_STUDY _ an r&D_PROJECT carried out in the concentrated
SOLAR_POWER_SECTOR _ in which we propose and calculate the effect of
providing the grant 2 YEARS earlier with a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS performed
over the DISCOUNT_RATE, VOLATILITY and first COMMERCIAL_REVENUE. this
paper may encourage FUNDING bodies to consider implementing
ALTERNATIVE_GRANT_SCHEMES valuing the FLEXIBILITY embedded in
r&D_PROJECTS.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD
