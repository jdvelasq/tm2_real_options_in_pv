Title: OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY for SOLAR_PV_INTEGRATION in
RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS: a CASE_STUDY in the PHILIPPINES
Abstract:
```
in DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, particularly in RURAL_AREAS, LONG_PERIODS of
POWER_OUTAGES are experienced as the ELECTRICITY_GRID is technically or
economically unfeasible. as SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) is the most potential
and SUITABLE_SOURCE of RENEWABLE_ENERGY for these areas, this
PAPER_ANALYZES the ECONOMIC_VIABILITY of its INTEGRATION in
DIFFERENT_TYPES of RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS. applying REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH
under UNCERTAINTY in ELECTRICITY_PRICES, this STUDY_COMPARES the
attractiveness of adopting SOLAR_PV over continuing ELECTRICITY from the
grid focusing on VARIOUS_INVESTMENT_PAYMENT_SCHEMES including (i)
FULL_PAYMENT, (ii) distributed payment for 5 or 10 YEARS without a down
payment, and (iii) distributed payment for 5 or 10 YEARS with 20% or 40%
down payment. applying the model with the case of the PHILIPPINES, the
results with the FULL_PAYMENT_STRATEGY obtain OPTION_VALUES of usd 6888
for building type_i, usd 15349 for building type_ii, usd 21204 for
building type_iii, usd 27870 for building type_iv, and usd 34251 for
building type_v. these OPTION_VALUES_INCREASE by 21.6% and 22.5% with
distributed PAYMENT_SCHEME to a 5_or 10_year period and increase by 5%
and 13% for distributed payment with 40% and 20% down payment. these
OPTION_VALUES decrease with INVESTMENTS at later periods. contrary to the
CONVENTIONAL_OPTION_VALUATION_RESULTS of an OPTIMAL_DECISION to wait, our
findings show the otherwise as earlier INVESTMENT_REDUCES the RISK of
OPPORTUNITY_LOSS from delaying the adoption of SOLAR_PV. among the
PAYMENT_SCHEMES analyzed, the distribution of PV_SYSTEM_COST in a 10_year
installment period without down PAYMENT_SHOWS to be the most
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY which may encourage lower_income and
risk_averse consumers whose decision to adopt SOLAR_PV is affected by
COST_BARRIERS, ECONOMIC_STATUS, and HOUSEHOLD_INCOME. the STUDY_SUGGESTS
the GOVERNMENT, particularly in DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, to support the
INTEGRATION of own_use SOLAR_PV in BUILDINGS through incentives and
subsidies, as well as FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS to offer more
AFFORDABLE_TERMS of payment that encourages low to
MEDIUM_INCOME_HOUSEHOLDS to adopt SOLAR_PV. further, this will not only
augment the ENERGY_DEFICIENCY in these countries but also support the
GLOBAL_ASPIRATIONS of reducing GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS and its
ADVERSE_EFFECTS through gradually shifting to RENEWABLE_SOURCES of
ENERGY.  2021. the authors. published by cbiore.
