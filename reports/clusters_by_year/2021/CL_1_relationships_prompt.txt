Title: a comparison of the REGIONAL_INVESTMENT_BENEFITS of CCS_RETROFITTING of
COAL fired POWER_PLANTS and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS in CHINA
Abstract:
```
CARBON_DIOXIDE (co2) capture and storage (ccs) TECHNOLOGY and
RENEWABLE_POWER are indispensable in CHINA's power sector to limit
GLOBAL_WARMING to 2c. because the two technologies have their OWN_MERITS
and weaknesses, it is important to understand their INVESTMENT_BENEFITS
and choose a cost_effective portfolio. therefore, we conducted an
INVESTMENT_EVALUATION of CCS_RETROFITTING of coal_fired POWER_PLANTS
(cfpp) with HYPOTHETICAL_SUBSIDIES and
RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS (rpp) by using a
REAL_OPTION_TRINOMIAL_TREE PRICING model and compared their
ECONOMIC_BENEFITS in DIFFERENT_PROVINCES in CHINA. the results showed
that when subsidies for the DESULFURIZATION_PRICE or the feed_in tariff
of WIND_POWER were adopted, the CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp did not achieve
the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_VALUE, even in 2027. if the decarbonized
ELECTRICITY_PRICE_INCREASES to 0.75 cny/kwh, equal to the feed_in tariff
of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC and BIOMASS_POWER, the CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp
would be commercially viable, and their INVESTMENT_VALUE would exceed
that of WIND POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS. in this situation, ningxia,
xinjiang, and GANSU_PROVINCES would be most suitable for the development
of CCS_RETROFITTING PILOT_PROJECTS; the advantages of the
CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp were not significant, WHEREAS_RPP was a better
INVESTMENT_CHOICE in many provinces. this paper provides a perspective on
feed_in tariffs for POLICY_MAKERS to use in formulating a SUBSIDY_SYSTEM
to support the development of ccs in CHINA, with POLICY_IMPLICATIONS for
other countries.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: valuing INVESTMENT_DECISIONS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PROJECTS considering
CHANGING_VOLATILITY
Abstract:
```
VOLATILITY is an IMPORTANT_PARAMETER when evaluating INVESTMENTS using
the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD. for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS, the VOLATILITY
of CASH_FLOW continuously changes, because as NEW_INFORMATION and
knowledge are gathered, there is less FORESEEN_VARIATION. this paper
proposes an extended recombining TRINOMIAL_TREE_MODEL, where the
CHANGING_VOLATILITY is used to GENERATE_TRANSITION_PROBABILITIES. the
CHANGING_VOLATILITY is generated using a CONSOLIDATION_PROCESS where
MULTIPLE_RANDOM_VARIABLES, including the MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY,
CARBON_PRICE, and lending rate, are integrated into a low_dimension
STOCHASTIC_PROCESS. a two_factor LEARNING_CURVE is used to model the
changes of INVESTMENT_COST. we apply the proposed model to
ANALYZE_SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_GENERATION_INVESTMENT in CHINA. the
results show VOLATILITY with changing feature. compared with
CONSTANT_VOLATILITY, CHANGING_VOLATILITY may advance INVESTMENT_DECISIONS
and change the PROJECT_VALUE. COMPLETE_GRID_PARITY_POLICY in the
SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY is infeasible because the OPPORTUNITY_COST brought by
the option of delaying cannot be offset. the CHANGING_VOLATILITY may
produce a lower and equally EFFECTIVE_SUBSIDY_LEVEL compared with
CONSTANT_VOLATILITY. a CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme is helpful in
advancing INVESTMENTS in RENEWABLE_ENERGY, which is reflected in
improvements in PROJECT_VALUE, advancements in INVESTMENT_DECISIONS, and
reductions in the required SUBSIDY_LEVEL.  2020 elsevier b.v.

Title: using REAL_OPTIONS to VALUE_CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and
INVESTMENT_EXPENDITURES in RENEWABLE_ENERGIES in INDIA
Abstract:
```
we calculate the OVERALL_POLICY_VALUE of installed CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and
INVESTMENT_EXPENDITURES in WIND and SOLAR_ENERGIES in INDIA.
RECENT_INCREASES in CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and INVESTMENTS by both the public
and PRIVATE_SECTORS along with GOVERNMENT_SUPPORT_SCHEMES have made these
energies more competitive with traditional FUELS like COAL in generating
ELECTRICITY. we use a two_factor LEARNING_CURVE to model the decline in
prices of WIND and SOLAR_ENERGIES. employing a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH with
GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES as the STOCHASTIC_VARIABLE we find the OVERALL_VALUE
of PROMOTION_POLICIES in RENEWABLES to be sufficiently large. the
TRIGGER_PRICE of COAL for INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGIES today for
ELECTRICITY_GENERATION suggest early to IMMEDIATE_DEPLOYMENT of
ADDITIONAL_WIND and SOLAR_TECHNOLOGIES as the OPTIMAL_POLICY. with the
option to deploy for a longer TIME_HORIZON, continuing with
PROMOTION_POLICIES of CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and INVESTMENT_EXPENDITURES in
RENEWABLES is more valuable at HIGH_GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES.  2020

Title: evaluating INDIAS_ENERGY_TARGETS using REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH
Abstract:
```
purpose: the AUTHORS_FORMULATE_INDIAS_ENERGY_TARGETS in light of pushing
for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES and reducing the dependence on imported
COAL. share of imported COAL in ELECTRICITY_GENERATION has been
approximately 10 per cent in RECENT_YEARS. while INVESTMENTS in
RENEWABLES have grown in RECENT_YEARS as seen in INSTALLED_CAPACITIES,
coal_fired ELECTRICITY_GENERATION has grown because of rising demand for
ELECTRICITY. the purpose of this study is to find a PLANNER_SOLUTION when
HIGH_GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES_FORCE greater INVESTMENTS in RENEWABLE_ENERGIES.
DESIGN/methodology/approach: the authors use REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH where
GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES are the STOCHASTIC_VARIABLE. they present an
OPTIMAL_STOPPING_PROBLEM and solving the PROBLEM_BACKWARD, the revenues
from continuing with the CURRENT_ENERGY_GENERATION_MIX and those from
replacing imported COAL with WIND_AND_SOLAR is compared for each period.
findings: the TRIGGER_PRICE for GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES when it is optimal for
the SOCIAL_PLANNER to invest in ADDITIONAL_WIND and SOLAR_CAPACITIES is
found. TRIGGER_PRICES is the threshold when INVESTMENT must be undertaken
whatever be the FUTURE_EVOLUTION of COAL_PRICES; this gives the problem a
value of waiting. INDIA cannot afford to wait to invest if faced with
strict short_term goals. originality/value: the WORK_EVALUATES_INDIAS
DOMESTIC_TARGETS and its PARIS_AGREEMENT_GOALS in light of using more of
WIND and sun and replacing imported COAL. VARIOUS_DATA_SOURCES
(GOVERNMENT_REPORTS, RESEARCH_ARTICLES) are consulted to predict shares
of ELECTRICITY from VARIOUS_SOURCES in FUTURE and the authors find the
OPERATING_COSTS and the INVESTMENT_COSTS associated with switching to
RENEWABLES.  2020, emerald publishing limited.
