Title: OPTIMAL_SUBSIDY_ESTIMATION_METHOD using SYSTEM_DYNAMICS and the
REAL_OPTION_MODEL: PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY_CASE
Abstract:
```
in this paper, we propose a method of optimizing FINANCIAL_SUBSIDIES and
PUBLIC_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENTS for
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, rather than optimizing FINANCIAL_SUBSIDY
alone. by combining SYSTEM_DYNAMICS with REAL_OPTION_MODELS, we capture
DYNAMIC_COMPLEX_INTERACTIONS among investors, consumers, and
policymakers, as well as FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES of KEY_ENERGY, economic,
and ENVIRONMENTAL_FACTORS. our method thereby makes SUBSIDY_OPTIMIZATION
more accurate and flexible. to evaluate our model, we apply it to the
KOREAN_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SUBSIDY and determine that the GOVERNMENT can achieve
the PHOTOVOLTAIC_DIFFUSION_TARGET, even if it reduces the TOTAL_SUBSIDY
by $us 359.5. million. the OPTIMAL_APPROACH is to increase
RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT FUNDING by $us 310.4. million while reducing the
FINANCIAL_SUBSIDY by $us 669.9. million. our method helps
POLICYMAKERS_OPTIMIZE their SUBSIDY_ALLOCATION and therefore
REDUCES_SUBSIDY_INEFFICIENCIES.  2015 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: a REAL_OPTION_MODEL for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POLICY_EVALUATION with
application to SOLAR_PV_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA
Abstract:
```
this study proposes a POLICY_EVALUATION_MODEL from the perspective of
GOVERNMENT and investors. the proposed model, which
INTEGRATES_AMERICAN_OPTION_METHOD and two_factor LEARNING_CURVE method,
can be used to evaluate the UNIT_DECISION_VALUE and save_path rate for
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_DEVELOPMENT and examine the existence of BALANCE_POINT
of interest. several UNCERTAIN_FACTORS including non_renewable ENERGY
COST, CARBON_PRICE, RENEWABLE_ENERGY_COST, and PRICE_SUBSIDY are all
considered in this model. the model has been applied to evaluate the
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_GENERATION in CHINA. our EMPIRICAL_RESULTS
show that REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS (ROA) is more effective than net
PRESENT_VALUE_ANALYSIS (NPV) when handling UNCERTAINTY. under
CURRENT_LEVEL of SUBSIDY, the GOVERNMENT would SUFFER_LOSS and the
investors could benefit so that it is difficult to achieve the balance of
interest during the PLANNING_PERIOD. with the reduction of SUBSIDY_RATE,
they can achieve the balance of interest.  2014 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: SOLAR_GRID_PARITY_DYNAMICS in ITALY: a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH
Abstract:
```
over the past three YEARS ITALY has seen a RAPID_GROWTH in the PV
(PHOTOVOLTAIC) ENERGY_MARKET, followed by an equally SUDDEN_DECLINE when
the GOVERNMENT decided to reduce the incentives. this sharp change in the
trend of the MARKET_CALLS into question the achievement of the so called
GRID_PARITY and the possibility that the MARKET is able to develop
independently. the motivation of this paper is to evaluate the effects
that uncertainties surrounding both the ENERGY_PRICES and PV_MODULE_COSTS
have on forecasting the dynamics of the ITALIAN_PV_MARKET. using the
REAL_OPTION_APPROACH we calculate "the best time to invest" in a
PV_SYSTEM by a maximizing investor. we show that these sources of
UNCERTAINTY can delay the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISION of several YEARS
compared to CURRENT_GRID_PARITY_FORECASTS, well describing the
CURRENT_MARKET_SITUATION in ITALY.  2014 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: distributed SOLAR RENEWABLE_GENERATION: OPTION_CONTRACTS with
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CREDIT_UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
SOLAR_ENERGY is rapidly emerging thanks to the decreasing
INSTALLATION_COST of SOLAR_PANELS and the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard
imposed by STATE_GOVERNMENTS, which gave birth to the
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CREDIT (rec) and the ALTERNATIVE_COMPLIANCE_PAYMENT
(acp). to make profits from the REC_MARKET in addition to reduced
ENERGY_COSTS, more and more home and BUSINESS_OWNERS choose to
INSTALL_SOLAR_PANELS. recently, third_party FINANCING has become a
COMMON_PRACTICE in SOLAR_PANEL_INVESTMENTS. we discuss OPTIMAL_TIMING for
the host to potentially buy back the SOLAR_PANELS after being installed
for a period of time and how to incorporate the OPTIMAL_TIMING into a
POWER_PURCHASE_AGREEMENT between the host and the third_party developer.
because the REC_PRICE is a MAJOR_SOURCE of UNCERTAINTY and also due to
the acp capping the REC_PRICE, we first propose a REC_PRICE forecasting
model that specifically considers the ACP_VALUES. then by a modified
REAL_OPTION_STRUCTURE, we model the BUYBACK_CONTRACT as a REAL_OPTION and
solve it with an approximate DYNAMIC_PROGRAM based
MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION_METHOD. we find that as the ACP_VALUE_INCREASES,
the value of the BUYBACK_OPTION also increases under OPTIMAL_TIMING. the
method used does not only apply to SOLAR_PROJECTS but also to other
distributed RENEWABLE_PROJECTS that are third_party financed, such as
WIND generations.  2015 elsevier b.v.

Title: MICROGRID_INVESTMENT under UNCERTAINTY: a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH using
closed FORM_CONTINGENT_ANALYSIS
Abstract:
```
the TRADITIONAL_NET PRESENT_VALUE_APPROACH to INVESTMENT in
MICROGRID_ASSETS does not take into account the INHERENT_UNCERTAINTIES in
FUEL_PRICES, COST of TECHNOLOGY, and MICROGRID_LOAD_PROFILE. we propose a
REAL_OPTION_APPROACH to MICROGRID_INVESTMENT, which includes
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) and gas_fired GENERATION_ASSETS. likewise the (n,
m) EXCHANGE_LITERATURE in REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS, we examine cases with
interdependency and independency of FUEL_PRICE and the COST of
PV_TECHNOLOGY. this work, however, makes a MAJOR_CONTRIBUTION by the way
of introducing a NEW_PARAMETER, which is defined as the elasticity of the
OPTION_VALUE to prices and is used in the formulation of closed
FORM_SOLUTIONS. we further extend the (1, 1) EXCHANGE_PROBLEM here to
include OPERATIONAL_FLEXIBILITY of MICROGRID, such that optimal switching
between INVESTMENT, suspension and re_activation can be examined.  2015,

Title: ECONOMIC_VIABILITY of KITE based WIND ENERGY_POWERSHIPS with CAES or
HYDROGEN_STORAGE
Abstract:
```
the rise in the usage of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in RECENT_YEARS
has been remarkable. still, the growth of these TECHNOLOGIES_POSES
FORMIDABLE_PROBLEMS, mainly concerning the GRID_INTEGRATION of
INTERMITTENT_ENERGY_SOURCES, such as WIND and SOLAR_POWER, by means of
advanced STORAGE_SYSTEMS, as well as the LAND_USE_REQUIREMENTS implied by
these LOW_ENERGY_DENSITY_RESOURCES. furthermore, the ECONOMIC_VIABILITY
of these solutions is in question, which is why to date they are often
still heavily subsidized. the POWERSHIP_CONCEPT_ATTEMPTS to tackle some
of these shortcomings by harvesting WIND ENERGY_OFFSHORE using an
ALTERNATIVE_INFRASTRUCTURAL_APPROACH featuring a special_purpose ship
towed by a high_flying KITE. the ship's resulting KINETIC_ENERGY is
partially converted by a WATER_REPELLER and can either be used to
compress and STORE_AIR in STEEL_TUBES (alternative 1) or to drive a
generator which in TURN_DELIVERS ELECTRICAL_ENERGY to produce HYDROGEN
(alternative 2). in this study, the ECONOMIC_FEASIBILITY of each of the
two alternatives is investigated and compared with each other using
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS, including both randd and MARKET_RISKS as
STOCHASTIC_VARIABLES driving the OPTION_VALUE. for determining the
STRATEGIC_VALUE of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY under UNCERTAINTY, assumptions
about changes of the ECONOMIC_ENVIRONMENT are made and motivated.  2015

Title: toward REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS of is enabled FLEXIBILITY in
ELECTRICITY_DEMAND
Abstract:
```
as the transition to WIND and SOLAR_PROGRESSES, the INTEGRATION of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES makes ELECTRICITY_PRODUCTION increasingly
fluctuating, also causing VOLATILITY in ELECTRICITY_PRICES on
ENERGY_MARKETS. in order to guarantee POWER_GRID_STABILITY,
UTILITIES_NEED to BALANCE_VOLATILE supply through shifting demand. this
measure of DEMAND_SIDE_MANAGEMENT_CREATES_FLEXIBILITY, being enabled as
the INTEGRATION of information and COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGY, e.g.
SMART_METERS and LOAD_CONTROL_SWITCHES, in the POWER_GRID grows. the
FLEXIBILITY of deferring consumption to times of lower demand or higher
supply bears an ECONOMIC_VALUE which can be quantified by recurring to
ELECTRICITY_MARKET_PRICES. our KERNEL_THEORY in terms of
DESIGN_SCIENCE_RESEARCH, REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY is the APPROPRIATE_APPROACH
for quantification under UNCERTAINTY. it provides for the assessment of
INVESTMENT_POTENTIAL in INFORMATION_SYSTEMS for LOAD_CONTROL. addressing
the prerequisite, we develop a STOCHASTIC_PROCESS which realistically
REPLICATES_ELECTRICITY_SPOT_PRICE_DEVELOPMENT. in further RESEARCH, we
will thereby assess the value of is_enabled FLEXIBILITY in
ELECTRICITY_DEMAND.

Title: VALUATION of MINERAL_PROJECT with FLEXIBILITY MAD_APPROACH vs.
CONSECUTIVE_STOCHASTIC_TREE;
Abstract:
```
for many YEARS, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) has been perceived as an
ATTRACTIVE_PROJECT_VALUATION alternative to the traditional discounted
CASH_FLOW_ANALYSIS (dcf). right now, one can see evidence of a growing
dispersion in the applicability of the method among VARIOUS_INDUSTRIES
(particularly MINERALS, COAL, gas and petroleum) and the banking sector.
this is because of its potential to VALUE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY
including possibilities for delaying INVESTMENTS or reformulating the
operating strategies of the company. the REAL_OPTION_APPROACH enables one
to calculate a projects FUNDAMENTAL_VALUE in approximating the MARKET
one. the basis of OPTION_THEORY is STOCHASTIC_MODELING of underlying
ASSETS _ the preferred, commonly used ROA_METHODOLOGY, introduced by
copeland and antikarov (2001), is called the mad (marketed
ASSET_DISCLAIMER) approach. it assumes that an underlying asset, which is
the (gross) PRESENT_VALUE of the project (PV), changes with time
according to the MULTIPLICATIVE_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS derived as
DISCRETE_BINOMIAL_APPROXIMATION of GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION (gbm). in
addition, the MAD_ASSUMES, that a TWIN_ASSET of the underlying instrument
is calculated in a COMMON_WAY_NET PRESENT_VALUE (NPV). the twin_asset
assumption fulfills the THEORETICAL_CRITERIA required for
FAIR_OPTION_VALUATION in no_arbitrage conditions. the
PAPER_DELIVERS_EMPIRICAL_ARGUMENTS arguing that indirect MODELING of pvs,
according to the STANDARD_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS, do not properly
REFLECT_REALITY. the calculations were based on the VALUATION of a
HARD_COAL_PROJECT with FLEXIBILITY _ the methodology has included
MULTIPLICATIVE_PRICE MODELING (that parameter has served as so called
REFERENTIAL_ASSET) and, consequently, built a CONSECUTIVE_PVS_TREE, where
RESPECTIVE_PRESENT_VALUES have been adjusted by REFERENTIAL_PRICE_LEVELS.
moreover, the paper has emphasized that the option_to_wait changes the
structure of PROJECTS_CASH_FLOW and PV_TREES, depending on the waiting
period. in conclusion, the arguments have been derived from the
consecutive MODELING of a PV_ASSET is more accurate than indirect
constructing of it in the MADS_MULTIPLICATIVE_MODE.  2015,
