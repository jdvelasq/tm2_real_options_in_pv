Title: COST effective DESIGN of RINGWALL_STORAGE_HYBRID_POWER_PLANTS: a
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
Abstract:
```
abstract we study the ECONOMIC_VIABILITY and optimal sizing and siting of
a HYBRID_PLANT that combines a RINGWALL_HYDRO_STORAGE_SYSTEM with WIND
and SOLAR_POWER_PLANTS (RINGWALL_STORAGE_HYBRID_POWER_PLANT, rshpp). a
REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL is introduced to analyze the ECONOMICS of an
ONSHORE_RSHPP, and in particular of the varying STORAGE_VOLUME in light
of the STOCHASTIC_CHARACTER of WIND and SOLAR_POWER, as well as the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING under UNCERTAINTY. in fact, many uncertainties
arise in such a project. ENERGY_PRODUCTION is determined by the
STOCHASTIC_CHARACTER of WIND and SOLAR_POWER, and affects the
OPTIMAL_SIZE of the STORAGE_DEVICE. MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION is performed
to analyze the following sources of UNCERTAINTY: (i) WIND intensity and
SOLAR_IRRADIATION; (ii) FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICE; and (iii)
INVESTMENT_COSTS. the RESULTS_YIELD the OPTIMAL_SIZE of the
STORAGE_DEVICE; the ENERGY_MARKET on which the operator should sell the
ELECTRICITY generated; NUMERICAL_EXAMPLES for two
DIFFERENT_RSHPP_SCENARIOS; and a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for analyzing the
opportunity to defer the PROJECT_INVESTMENT and thus to exploit the value
of waiting.  2015 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS_INVESTMENT_RISK_ANALYSIS in
GUIZHOU_PROVINCE, CHINA
Abstract:
```
in the NEW_ELECTRICITY_MARKET_ENVIRONMENT, PV_PROJECT_INVESTMENT faces
more INVESTMENT_RISKS. in order to guarantee the supply of ELECTRICITY
effectively and reduce CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS, it needs the
RELEVANT_GOVERNMENT_DEPARTMENTS to guide investors to invest in
CLEAN_ENERGY_GENERATION_PROJECTS with APPROPRIATE_POLICIES. based on
REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY, this paper develops a INVESTMENT decision_model and
a RISK_ASSESSMENT_FRAMEWORK for PV_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS in CHINA. in
the case of grid_connected PV_GENERATION_DEMONSTRATION_PROJECT, this
paper carry out INVESTMENT_DECISION_SIMULATION from the UNCERTAINTY of
INVESTMENT_COST. the SIMULATION_RESULTS show that the model can provide
investors an INVESTMENT_REFERENCE. meanwhile, it can be used as
QUANTITATIVE_ANALYSIS_TOOLS for POLICY_MAKERS to make a
REASONABLE_INVESTMENT_POLICY.  2014 ieee.
