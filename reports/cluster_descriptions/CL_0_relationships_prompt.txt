Title: a REAL_OPTION_MODEL for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POLICY_EVALUATION with
application to SOLAR_PV_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA
Abstract:
```
this study proposes a POLICY_EVALUATION_MODEL from the perspective of
GOVERNMENT and investors. the proposed model, which
INTEGRATES_AMERICAN_OPTION_METHOD and two_factor LEARNING_CURVE method,
can be used to evaluate the UNIT_DECISION_VALUE and save_path rate for
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_DEVELOPMENT and examine the existence of BALANCE_POINT
of interest. several UNCERTAIN_FACTORS including non_renewable ENERGY
COST, CARBON_PRICE, RENEWABLE_ENERGY_COST, and PRICE_SUBSIDY are all
considered in this model. the model has been applied to evaluate the
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_GENERATION in CHINA. our EMPIRICAL_RESULTS
show that REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS (ROA) is more effective than net
PRESENT_VALUE_ANALYSIS (NPV) when handling UNCERTAINTY. under
CURRENT_LEVEL of SUBSIDY, the GOVERNMENT would SUFFER_LOSS and the
investors could benefit so that it is difficult to achieve the balance of
interest during the PLANNING_PERIOD. with the reduction of SUBSIDY_RATE,
they can achieve the balance of interest.  2014 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: SOLAR_GRID_PARITY_DYNAMICS in ITALY: a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH
Abstract:
```
over the past three YEARS ITALY has seen a RAPID_GROWTH in the PV
(PHOTOVOLTAIC) ENERGY_MARKET, followed by an equally SUDDEN_DECLINE when
the GOVERNMENT decided to reduce the incentives. this sharp change in the
trend of the MARKET_CALLS into question the achievement of the so called
GRID_PARITY and the possibility that the MARKET is able to develop
independently. the motivation of this paper is to evaluate the effects
that uncertainties surrounding both the ENERGY_PRICES and PV_MODULE_COSTS
have on forecasting the dynamics of the ITALIAN_PV_MARKET. using the
REAL_OPTION_APPROACH we calculate "the best time to invest" in a
PV_SYSTEM by a maximizing investor. we show that these sources of
UNCERTAINTY can delay the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISION of several YEARS
compared to CURRENT_GRID_PARITY_FORECASTS, well describing the
CURRENT_MARKET_SITUATION in ITALY.  2014 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: assessment of DOMESTIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS based on REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY
Abstract:
```
in the last decade, the FINANCIAL_ATTRACTIVENESS of PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV)
systems has been increasing due to the rapid and CONSTANT_IMPROVEMENTS of
PV_TECHNOLOGIES and the introduction of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SUPPORT_MECHANISMS. under these circumstances,
RESIDENTIAL_ELECTRICITY_CONSUMERS can benefit from INVESTMENTS in
DOMESTIC_PV_SYSTEMS. INVESTMENT_DECISIONS in PV_SYSTEMS can be assessed
with well_known discounted cash flows criteria such as the COST of ENERGY
and the net PRESENT_VALUE. these types of analyses either recommend
abandoning the project or investing immediately. however, due to
FAST_IMPROVEMENTS in PV_TECHNOLOGIES, especially in the last few YEARS,
options to POSTPONE_INVESTMENTS in PV_SYSTEMS can be valuable. these
options can be assessed with REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY. this paper proposes a
REAL_OPTIONS_METHODOLOGY for the assessment of DOMESTIC_PV_SYSTEMS,
considering the expected evolution of PV_TECHNOLOGIES and the option to
DELAY_INVESTMENT. the methodology employs a NORMALIZATION_TECHNIQUE to
illustrate, in a simple and INTUITIVE_MANNER, the convenience of the
DELAY_OPTION. two CASE_STUDIES based on real aggregated data for the uk
are presented. the first CASE_STUDY_ILLUSTRATES the methodology, whereas
the second is an EXTENSIVE_STUDY meant to provide insights about
INVESTMENTS in DOMESTIC_PV_SYSTEMS in the uk. the results indicate the
circumstances that drive and DISINCENTIVIZE_INVESTMENTS in
DIFFERENT_PV_TECHNOLOGIES. additionally, it is shown that the option to
DELAY_INVESTMENT is a POTENTIAL_DRIVER for INVESTMENTS in emerging
organic_based PV_TECHNOLOGIES. copyright  2012 JOHN_WILEY & sons, ltd.
the use of REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY can lead to the enhancement of the
ECONOMIC_ATTRACTIVENESS of DOMESTIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) projects.
additionally, it can facilitate the penetration of organic_based
PV_TECHNOLOGIES for the generation of power in the DOMESTIC_SECTOR. this
paper proposes a real options_based methodology with the
AFOREMENTIONED_CHARACTERISTICS for the planning of DOMESTIC_PV_SYSTEMS

Title: REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS of INVESTMENT in SOLAR vs. WIND_ENERGY:
DIVERSIFICATION_STRATEGIES under UNCERTAIN_PRICES and COSTS
Abstract:
```
in this paper we study a community or firm considering to diversify its
INVESTMENT in two distinct RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, namely WIND and
SOLAR_PV_ELECTRICITY. we assume TECHNOLOGICAL_LEARNING_CURVES as a
function of CUMULATIVE_CAPITAL_INVESTMENT. a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH is
applied as it takes into ACCOUNT_UNCERTAINTY about prices and learning,
as well as IRREVERSIBILITY associated with INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. we
investigate three DIFFERENT_CASES, dealing with UNCERTAINTY about
FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES, and UNCERTAINTY about the speed with which
learning drives the COSTS of WIND and SOLAR_ELECTRICITY down. we assess
the MINIMUM_THRESHOLD for the STOCHASTIC_PRICE and the
MAXIMUM_ELECTRICITY_PRODUCTION_COST that makes it optimal for the firm to
invest in the two technologies. the results show that the
LEARNING_RATE_AFFECTS the option to invest in but reducing
CRITICAL_THRESHOLD for exercising it. the greater the amount of CAPITAL
invested, the more LEARNING_STIMULATES earlier exercising of the option
to invest. the firm will then anticipate the option to invest and
exercise it for lower CRITICAL_THRESHOLD_VALUES if all CAPITAL is
invested in one TECHNOLOGY. if CAPITAL_INVESTMENT is diversified, the
option should be exercised at a higher CRITICAL_THRESHOLD. more
UNCERTAINTY in ENERGY_PRICES or TECHNOLOGY_COSTS_POSTPONES the option to
invest. although investing in both SOLAR and WIND may be profitable under
PARTICULAR_CONDITIONS of price and COST_UNCERTAINTY, the theoretically
OPTIMAL_STRATEGY is generally investing in only one TECHNOLOGY, that is,
SOLAR or WIND, depending on their RELATIVE_INITIAL_COSTS and
LEARNING_RATES. this suggests that the practice in most countries of
diversifying RENEWABLE_ENERGY may reflect a MISTAKEN_STRATEGY.  2017

Title: REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_INVESTMENTS in existing
BUILDINGS
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION based on SOLAR_ENERGY is deemed to be a
KEY_INSTRUMENT to reduce the CARBON_FOOTPRINT of MODERN_ECONOMIES.
collectively, BUILDINGS are an energy_intensive consumption sector.
therefore, existing BUILDING_ROOFTOPS are seen as a target for massively
deploying PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) DISTRIBUTED_GENERATION. nevertheless,
estimating the benefits and RISKS of investing in ROOFTOP_PV_SYSTEMS is
indeed a CHALLENGING_TASK due to the LARGE_UNCERTAINTIES that affect
tariffs, TECHNOLOGY_COSTS, and REGULATORY_POLICY. after reviewing the
literature and identifying the CURRENT_GAPS, this ARTICLE develops a
method based on REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY for appraising INVESTMENTS in
PV_GENERATION_SYSTEMS to be installed on the rooftop of existing
BUILDINGS. the OPTION_VALUE of differing the INVESTMENT_DECISION and the
problem of the OPTIMAL_TIME to invest in IRREVERSIBLE_PV_ASSETS are
addressed by an advanced VALUATION_METHOD based on STOCHASTIC_SIMULATION,
LINEAR_REGRESSION, and backward DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING. in this work,
returns of self_generation PV INVESTMENTS are subjected to uncertainties
upon declining INVESTMENT_COSTS and fluctuating ELECTRICITY_TARIFFS,
which are represented by APPROPRIATE_EXOGENOUS_STOCHASTIC_PROCESSES. in
order to test the practicability of the proposed decision_making
framework, the VALUATION of an exemplary rooftop pv_system in a
GOVERNMENT_BUILDING is considered. results show that while
STANDARD_APPRAISAL_METHODS wrongly reject the ROOFTOP_PV_PROJECT now and
in the FUTURE, the OPTION_VALUATION_METHOD finds optimal to hold the
opportunity open in order to reconsider to invest later. in addition, the
method provides an OBJECTIVE_VALUE of the OPPORTUNITY_COST of using the
building rooftop for another purpose. the proposed VALUATION_APPROACH
would result in better INVESTMENT_ALLOCATION and faster development of
distributed PV_POWER_CAPACITY contributing thereby to enhance the
SUSTAINABILITY of CURRENT_ENERGY_SYSTEMS.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

Investment decisions in renewable energy, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, are complex, influenced by uncertainties in costs, prices, and technology improvements. Real Options Analysis (ROA) provides a robust framework for these decisions, considering uncertainty and the value of managerial flexibility. For instance, in China, a study integrating the American Option Method and a learning curve method found that ROA is more effective than traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in handling uncertainty in renewable energy policy evaluation, highlighting the balance of interests between government and investors [149]. In Italy, the rapid growth and subsequent decline in the PV energy market, due to changes in government incentives, demonstrated that uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs can significantly delay the optimal investment decision, as assessed through a real option approach [130]. 

Similarly, in the UK, the financial attractiveness of domestic PV systems has been enhanced by real options theory, which considers the option to delay investment in light of rapid technology improvements [133]. A comparative study of investment in solar vs. wind energy using ROA showed that learning rates affect the critical threshold for investment decisions, suggesting that under certain conditions, investing in one technology (solar or wind) might be more optimal than diversifying [33]. The valuation of PV power investments in existing buildings further illustrates the challenges of estimating benefits and risks due to uncertainties in tariffs, technology costs, and regulatory policy. A method based on ROA and stochastic simulation suggested that while standard appraisal methods might reject rooftop PV projects, the option valuation method finds it optimal to keep the investment opportunity open for future consideration [97]. These records collectively emphasize the importance of considering uncertainties and managerial flexibility in making accurate and dynamic investment decisions in renewable energy sectors.

Title: distributed SOLAR RENEWABLE_GENERATION: OPTION_CONTRACTS with
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CREDIT_UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
SOLAR_ENERGY is rapidly emerging thanks to the decreasing
INSTALLATION_COST of SOLAR_PANELS and the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard
imposed by STATE_GOVERNMENTS, which gave birth to the
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CREDIT (rec) and the ALTERNATIVE_COMPLIANCE_PAYMENT
(acp). to make profits from the REC_MARKET in addition to reduced
ENERGY_COSTS, more and more home and BUSINESS_OWNERS choose to
INSTALL_SOLAR_PANELS. recently, third_party FINANCING has become a
COMMON_PRACTICE in SOLAR_PANEL_INVESTMENTS. we discuss OPTIMAL_TIMING for
the host to potentially buy back the SOLAR_PANELS after being installed
for a period of time and how to incorporate the OPTIMAL_TIMING into a
POWER_PURCHASE_AGREEMENT between the host and the third_party developer.
because the REC_PRICE is a MAJOR_SOURCE of UNCERTAINTY and also due to
the acp capping the REC_PRICE, we first propose a REC_PRICE forecasting
model that specifically considers the ACP_VALUES. then by a modified
REAL_OPTION_STRUCTURE, we model the BUYBACK_CONTRACT as a REAL_OPTION and
solve it with an approximate DYNAMIC_PROGRAM based
MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION_METHOD. we find that as the ACP_VALUE_INCREASES,
the value of the BUYBACK_OPTION also increases under OPTIMAL_TIMING. the
method used does not only apply to SOLAR_PROJECTS but also to other
distributed RENEWABLE_PROJECTS that are third_party financed, such as
WIND generations.  2015 elsevier b.v.

Investment decisions in renewable energy, especially in solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, are increasingly complex due to uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements. Real Options Analysis (ROA) offers a comprehensive framework for these decisions by accounting for uncertainty and the value of managerial flexibility. For example, a study in China utilized the American Option Method alongside a learning curve method, showing that ROA surpasses traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in addressing uncertainties in renewable energy policy, emphasizing the need for balance between government and investor interests [149]. This complexity is echoed in Italy's PV energy market, where the rapid rise and fall, attributed to fluctuating government incentives, revealed that uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs could significantly postpone the optimal investment decision, as per the real option approach [130].

In the UK, the attractiveness of domestic PV systems was bolstered by real options theory, which evaluates the option to defer investment in response to rapid technological improvements [133]. A comparative analysis of investments in solar versus wind energy, using ROA, indicated that learning rates influence the critical threshold for investment decisions. This suggests that under specific conditions, focusing on a single technology, either solar or wind, could be more advantageous than diversification [33]. Furthermore, the valuation of PV power investments in existing buildings highlighted the difficulty in estimating benefits and risks owing to uncertainties in tariffs, technological costs, and regulatory policy. A method combining ROA with stochastic simulation proposed that, while standard appraisal techniques might initially reject rooftop PV projects, the option valuation approach deems it beneficial to maintain the investment opportunity for future reconsideration [97]. 

Moreover, in the context of distributed solar generation, the uncertainty in Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) impacts investment decisions. Optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments is crucial, and these can be modeled as real options, incorporating uncertainties in REC prices, as shown in a study by Zeng [154]. The challenges in designing off-grid microgrids in developing countries, with uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, also exemplify the need for a novel stochastic dynamic method in investment planning, emphasizing the importance of multi-year optimization tools over traditional single-year methods [45]. 

The uncertainty in renewable energy investments, specifically in solar power projects, has been addressed through the development of numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method. This method integrates option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, highlighting the importance of assessing the optimal timing for launching such projects [75]. Residential photovoltaic investments, too, showcase the need for a decision-making framework that considers the optimal timing for investment under demand uncertainties. This framework uses the Real Option Method to analyze different investment strategies for maximizing long-term investment gains [160]. Lastly, evaluating investments in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory illustrates the need for proper financial valuation models in decision-making, especially when considering the installation of PV technologies at an optimal future time [102]. 

These records collectively underscore the critical role of considering uncertainties and the value of managerial flexibility in making accurate and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector.

UNCERTAINTY in FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES, investors have
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY in the form of deferring INVESTMENT and
considering VARIOUS_SYSTEM_SIZES, which can affect and improve
SYSTEM_VALUATIONS. considering that variation in ELECTRICITY_PRICES can
jeopardize the TIMELY_INSTALLATION of an optimally sized
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM, the objective of this paper is to propose a
REAL_OPTION_FRAMEWORK to model the price of ELECTRICITY and account for
the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY when valuing building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. a CASE_STUDY using the framework is conducted to
calculate the net PRESENT_VALUE of a real_life building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECT in daejeon, SOUTH_KOREA. it was found that the
OPTIMAL_DECISION for would_be building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM_OWNERS is to wait to invest in building integrated
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS when there are HIGH_LEVELS of UNCERTAINTY in
FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICES. this holds true even if the net PRESENT_VALUES
for systems without options are positive. when applying this strategy to
the apartment complex in the CASE_STUDY, it generated an OPTION_VALUE of
approximately $87,000.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL to evaluate INFRASTRUCTURE_FLEXIBILITY: an application
to PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY
Abstract:
```
the HIGH_LEVEL of UNCERTAINTY characterising the FUTURE_MARKET_DEMAND in
many industrial, sectors makes it necessary to use
STRATEGIC_INVESTMENT_EVALUATION_MODELS that foresee the possibility of
determining and managing UNCERTAINTY in order to be able to fully take
the potentials for creating the value associated with it. by using the
approach of REAL_OPTIONS in this work, a MATHEMATICAL_MODEL is provided
for choosing a STRATEGIC_INVESTMENT in the PHOTOVOLTAIC_INDUSTRY; this
model allows MANAGEMENT to handle the UNCERTAINTY of the demand that
cannot otherwise be dealt with by using the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) as a
tool to SUPPORT_DECISIONS. moreover, it will be shown how this
EVALUATION_MODEL is able to reduce the RISK of a STRATEGIC_INVESTMENT, if
compared to the NPV, and point out the hidden VALUE_DRIVERS of a
MANAGERIAL_DECISION.

Abstract:
```
INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY, such as BUILDING_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV), has
higher VOLATILITY than NORMAL_PRODUCTS due to
UNCERTAIN_PRODUCT_PERFORMANCE and SUCH_HIGH_UNCERTAINTIES become the
roadblock to the growth of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_MARKET.
PREVIOUS_STUDIES_FOCUS on DIFFUSION_OF_INNOVATION from MACRO_ASPECT but
ignore the MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY of individual's INVESTMENT. this paper
established a NOVEL_DIFFUSION_MODEL that integrates agent_based modelling
(abm), REAL_OPTION and SOCIAL_NETWORKS to assess the propagation of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_ADOPTION. the proposed MODEL_INCORPORATES the
heterogeneity of individuals' RISK_PREFERENCES into REAL_OPTION_DECISION
to determine one'S_WILLINGNESS to invest RENEWABLE_ENERGY. the
PERCEPTUAL_RISKS vary through one'S_INTERACTION with NETWORK_PEERS after
knowing the PAST_EXPERIENCES from those peers. the model is then applied
to the RESIDENTIAL_PV_DIFFUSION in SINGAPORE, with results that validate
the effectiveness of the model and also imply POLICY_RECOMMENDATIONS to
stimulate the development of PV_MARKET. copyright  2018 ELSEVIER_LTD. all

Title: VALUATION of defer and RELOCATION_OPTIONS in
PHOTOVOLTAIC_GENERATION_INVESTMENTS by a STOCHASTIC_SIMULATION based
method
Abstract:
```
RISK_MANAGEMENT is crucial when committing INVESTMENTS in
ELECTRICITY_MARKETS. INVESTMENT_PROJECTS for the generation of
ELECTRICITY are capital_intensive, in LARGE_PART_IRREVERSIBLE and
FUTURE_PERFORMANCE is subject to HIGH_UNCERTAINTY. fortunately, most
POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS have STRATEGIC_FLEXIBILITY for handling
UNCERTAINTY and for mitigating RISKS under UNFAVORABLE_SCENARIOS. modern
corporate FINANCE recognizes REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS (ROA) as the
CORRECT_WAY to VALUE_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS with these characteristics. due
to both, ENVIRONMENTAL_CONCERNS and escalation of FUEL_PRICES,
ELECTRICITY_GENERATION from RENEWABLE_SOURCES has grown dramatically
worldwide over the last decade. RENEWABLE_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS share many
of the features mentioned. as such, OPTION_VALUATION_METHODS should be
applied to estimate the MONETARY_VALUE of FLEXIBILITY in
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS. this work presents an
APPROPRIATE_METHODOLOGY for assessing the ECONOMIC_VALUE of a
PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANT under uncertainties. ROA is applied to determine
the value of delaying the INVESTMENT_DECISION while waiting for better
MARKET_INFORMATION that would reduce ACQUISITION_COSTS due to progress in
SOLAR_TECHNOLOGY. the FLEXIBILITY of relocating the SOLAR_FACILITY in the
FUTURE upon the appearance of a more ATTRACTIVE_SITE in terms of COST,
NETWORK_ACCESSIBILITY or REGULATORY_POLICIES is also valued. the problem
of OPTION_VALUATION is solved through STOCHASTIC_SIMULATION combined with
RECURSIVE_APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING techniques. the methodology
developed might be used by investors for more efficient decision_making
and by REGULATORY_AGENCIES for designing ADEQUATE_SUPPORT_POLICIES that
encourage INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

Investment decisions in renewable energy, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, have grown increasingly complex due to uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements. Real Options Analysis (ROA) offers a sophisticated framework for these decisions by incorporating uncertainty and the value of managerial flexibility. In China, a study utilizing the American Option Method and a learning curve method demonstrated that ROA is more effective than traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis for handling uncertainties in renewable energy policy, emphasizing the necessity of a balance between government and investor interests [149]. In Italy, the volatile PV energy market, influenced by changing government incentives, illustrated that uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs could significantly delay the optimal investment decision, as determined through a real option approach [130].

In the UK, the appeal of domestic PV systems was enhanced by real options theory, which provides a framework to defer investment in light of rapid technological improvements [133]. A comparative study on investments in solar versus wind energy using ROA indicated that learning rates influence the critical threshold for investment decisions, suggesting that under certain circumstances, focusing on one technology might be more beneficial than diversification [33]. Additionally, the assessment of PV power investments in existing buildings highlighted the challenges in estimating benefits and risks due to uncertainties in tariffs, technological costs, and regulatory policy. A method integrating ROA with stochastic simulation found that while standard appraisal methods might initially reject rooftop PV projects, the option valuation approach advocates maintaining the investment opportunity for future reassessment [97].

The uncertainty in Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) impacts investment decisions in distributed solar generation. Optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments is essential, and these can be modeled as real options, accounting for uncertainties in REC prices, as demonstrated by Zeng [154]. The complexity in designing off-grid microgrids in developing countries, given uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, highlights the need for innovative stochastic dynamic methods in investment planning, advocating multi-year optimization tools over traditional single-year methods [45].

The uncertainty in solar power project investments has been addressed through the development of advanced numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method. This method combines option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of determining the optimal timing for project initiation [75]. Residential photovoltaic investments also demonstrate the need for a decision-making framework that considers the optimal timing for investment under demand uncertainties, utilizing the Real Option Method to analyze different investment strategies for maximizing long-term gains [160].

Evaluating investments in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory underscores the necessity for precise financial valuation models in decision-making, especially when considering the installation of PV technologies at an optimal future time [102]. Furthermore, determining the optimal timing for installing building-integrated PV systems becomes crucial under price uncertainties, adding another layer of managerial flexibility in investment decisions [89]. The development of an innovation diffusion model for renewable energy deployment, incorporating agent-based modeling and real options, illustrates the impact of individual risk preferences and social networks on renewable energy investment decisions, providing valuable insights for policy recommendations to stimulate the PV market [26]. Additionally, assessing the demand response value in PV systems based on real options theory reflects the growing importance of considering environmental concerns in investment decisions [111]. Finally, the valuation of defer and relocation options in PV generation investments by a stochastic simulation-based method highlights the significance of risk management and strategic flexibility in electricity markets, emphasizing the need for appropriate methodologies to assess the economic value of PV power plants under uncertainties [3].

These records collectively underline the critical importance of considering uncertainties and the value of managerial flexibility in making accurate and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector, particularly in solar PV power generation.

Abstract:
```
nowadays, the photovoltaic_energy storage system (pv_ess) has not
achieved large_scale development. the role of ESS_INCENTIVE_MECHANISMS
has been emphasized for promoting the DIFFUSION of pv_ess TECHNOLOGY.
therefore, to explore REASONABLE_ESS_INCENTIVE_MECHANISMS in CHINA, this
paper develops a compound REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL by considering the
flexibilities and uncertainties of the INVESTMENT and OPERATIONAL_STAGE.
the impact of the CARBON_EMISSION trading MARKET,
AUXILIARY_SERVICE_MARKET, and DIFFERENT_ESS_INCENTIVE_POLICIES and their
SYNERGISTIC_ACTIONS on pv_ess INVESTMENT have been explored by
considering the SOCIAL_WELFARE of all related stakeholders. moreover, a
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS on the scale of expanding the INVESTMENT and
INCENTIVE_INTENSITY for ess is conducted. the results show that the
ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY is more favorable for investing in the pv_ess
project. the INVESTMENT will be brought forward 2 YEARS compared to the
situation without INCENTIVE_POLICY. in addition, from the perspective of
SOCIAL_WELFARE, the effects of the combinations of three
ESS_INCENTIVE_POLICIES are better than any single ESS_POLICY, and the
PROJECT_VALUE and SOCIAL_WELFARE_INCREASES by at least 3.46 and 7.99
million yuan, respectively. ILLUSTRATIVE_EXAMPLES can provide references

Abstract:
```
SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT represents currently a VALID_REASON to support
SUSTAINABLE_ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT. in fact, over the last few YEARS,
governments have applied DIFFERENT_MEASURES to incentivize
PRIVATE_CONSUMERS and firms to use RENEWABLE_ENERGIES. PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV)
projects are characterized by UNCERTAINTY due to
METEOROLOGICAL_CONDITIONS, the UNPREDICTABLE_BEHAVIOR of GOVERNMENT, and
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY. since the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) approach is not
able to capture these UNCERTAIN_FACTORS, it was replaced with the
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH (ROA). the latter METHOD_MANAGES to embed
FLEXIBILITY in PV_INVESTMENT using BINOMIAL_TREES. this
PAPER_VALUATES_PV_INVESTMENT in all REGIONAL_AREAS in ITALY using an
integrated approach between the discounted cash flows method and
REAL_OPTION_VALUE, called expanded net PRESENT_VALUE (ENPV). we fit the
PROBABILITY of TAX_BENEFITS into a BINOMIAL_LATTICE_MODEL after analyzing
the GEOGRAPHICAL_POSITION and WEATHER_CONDITIONS of all REGIONAL_CAPITALS
of ITALY. the results show that the cities with high
irradiance/temperature have POSITIVE_NPV and HIGH_INVESTMENT_VALUES. on
the other hand, while most cities have NEGATIVE_NPV, the inclusion of the
FLEXIBILITY in INVESTMENT_DECISIONS gives ADDITIONAL_VALUE to the
project, making the ENPV positive and implying an
ATTRACTIVE_INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITY with the possibility of delaying the
project. we also propose a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS that shows how the

Title: is it a GOOD_TIME to develop COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS on FARMLAND?
an american style option with CROP_PRICE_RISK
Abstract:
```
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS require LARGE_SWATHS of land that are currently
being used for other purposes, such as farming. one option for developing
LARGE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS is converting FARMS that are currently
economically unviable into COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. however, this
may not always be an economically RATIONAL_DECISION as CROP_PRICES have
the potential to increase over time. fluctuations in FARM_INCOME due to
changes in CROP_PRICES can alter the OPTIMAL_CHOICE of whether to
continue farming or to convert FARMLAND into
COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. this STUDY_ATTEMPTS to resolve this
issue by proposing a REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK to VALUE_FARM_PRODUCTION when
CROP_PRICES are uncertain. by integrating UNCERTAINTY into the
decision_making process, the value of keeping UNPROFITABLE_FARMS
operating prior to developing the area into a
COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM is assessed. this helps DECISION_MAKERS
understand the extent to which POTENTIAL_INCOME from developing a
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM should be greater than POTENTIAL_INCOME from farming
when deciding on investing in a PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM. a CASE_STUDY is
conducted to examine this framework and to calculate the net
PRESENT_VALUE of a farm in SOUTH_KOREA. the results indicate that
although the money lost from continuing to farm is substantial, farmers
should DEFER_CONVERSION to a COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM until a
SUFFICIENT_DROP in CROP_PRICES_OCCURS. when applying this strategy, the
farmer can gain an additional 100% of expected revenue simply by
deferring the DEVELOPMENT_DECISION until having better information on the
MARKET_PRICES of CROPS.  2020 ELSEVIER_LTD

Abstract:
```
in this work, a NOVEL_METHODOLOGY based on the REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY has
been developed for the EVALUATION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_PROJECTS with a
capacity greater than 100 kw in france. FRENCH_LEGISLATION that regulates
these types of projects presents two REAL_OPTIONS: on the one hand, the
producer has a put option that consists of choosing between a feed_in
tariff system and ELECTRICITY_MARKET_SALE_PRICES every year, and this put
OPTION_COINCIDES with PUBLIC_SUBSIDIES granted by the
FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION. on the other hand, the FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION has a
CALL_OPTION that provides a benefit to the PUBLIC_SECTOR. this
OPTION_SUPPOSES a limit on the subsidized PRODUCTION of ELECTRICITY and
reduces the value of the project to the promoter. the value of the put
option is 4.28  per mwh generated. the extended net PRESENT_VALUE has a
value of 5.26 million euros. the BREAKEVEN_POINT of the project is
achieved with an increase of 59% in the regulated rate. this means that
the FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION must increase the value of PUBLIC_SUBSIDIES if
it wants to develop large_scale projects.  2020 by the author.

Title: r&D_INVESTMENT_DECISION on SMART_CITIES: ENERGY_SUSTAINABILITY and
opportunity
Abstract:
```
PUBLIC_ADMINISTRATIONS frequently tend to make communities as much
sustainable as possible pursuing SMART_CITY_GOALS.
SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS represent a VALID_OPPORTUNITY to
SUPPORT_SMART_CITIES and consequently the
SUSTAINABLE_ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT. the VALUATION of these projects is not
a SIMPLE_TASK considering their SEQUENTIAL_NATURE and riskiness. this
ARTICLE proposes a compound REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH (ROA) as a tool for
POTENTIAL_INVESTORS to make a CONSCIOUS_R&d RENEWABLE_INVESTMENT_DECISION
on SMART_CITIES. in this sense, we fit the COMPOUND_ROA with the
framework of a TYPICAL_SMART_CITY_PROJECT in SOLAR_ENERGY_FIELD. we also
provide a CASE_STUDY to make a comparison between classical expected net
PRESENT_VALUE (ENPV) approach and COMPOUND_ROA. the results show that
ENPV_UNDERESTIMATES the PROJECT_VALUE, WHEREAS_COMPOUND_ROA allows to
obtain a more ATTRACTIVE_VALUATION of the project by embedding in the
analysis the MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY_VALUE.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: impact of FLEXIBILITY in PUBLIC_R&d FUNDING: how REAL_OPTIONS could avoid
the CROWDING_OUT effect
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_EXPLORES NEW_MECHANISMS to ENSURE_GRANTS are additional to
PRIVATE_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT with no displacing or
crowding_out effect. our results indicate that by studying the
FLEXIBILITY embedded in these type of projects, using the
REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK, it is possible to reduce the size of grants given
by FINANCING bodies while remaining equally attractive to companies. this
result is reached due to the higher FLEXIBILITY provided in potential
NEW_GRANT_SCHEMES. in addition to the OBVIOUS_CONSEQUENCE of less
EXPENSIVE_PUBLIC_R&d FUNDING, there are other SIDE_BENEFITS to this
NEW_SCHEME, such as avoiding the crowding_out effect while also allowing
more honest and SINCERE_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT by companies
because they are sharing the RISK with the FUNDING body. this paper
presents a CASE_STUDY _ an r&D_PROJECT carried out in the concentrated
SOLAR_POWER_SECTOR _ in which we propose and calculate the effect of
providing the grant 2 YEARS earlier with a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS performed
over the DISCOUNT_RATE, VOLATILITY and first COMMERCIAL_REVENUE. this
paper may encourage FUNDING bodies to consider implementing
ALTERNATIVE_GRANT_SCHEMES valuing the FLEXIBILITY embedded in
r&D_PROJECTS.  2017 ELSEVIER_LTD

In the realm of renewable energy investments, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, the increasing complexities due to uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements necessitate a sophisticated approach to investment decisions. Real Options Analysis (ROA) offers such a framework, enabling a nuanced response to uncertainty and providing the flexibility for managerial decision-making. In China, an integration of the American Option Method with a learning curve method revealed that ROA is more adept than traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in navigating uncertainties in renewable energy policy, highlighting the essential balance between government and investor interests [149]. Similarly, in Italy, the volatile PV market, affected by fluctuating government incentives, demonstrated how uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs could significantly postpone the optimal investment decision, as determined through a real option approach [130].

In the UK, the appeal of domestic PV systems was augmented by the application of real options theory, which supports a strategy to defer investment in light of swift technological advancements [133]. A comparative analysis of investments in solar versus wind energy using ROA indicated that learning rates critically influence investment decisions, suggesting that under certain scenarios, a focus on one technology could be more advantageous than diversification [33]. Additionally, the evaluation of PV power investments in existing buildings brought to light the complexities in estimating the benefits and risks due to uncertainties in tariffs, technology costs, and regulatory policies. A methodology that merges ROA with stochastic simulation suggested that while conventional appraisal methods might initially overlook rooftop PV projects, the option valuation method proposes keeping the investment opportunity open for future reevaluation [97].

The uncertainty associated with Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) plays a significant role in investment decisions in distributed solar generation. Optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments becomes essential, and these scenarios can be effectively modeled as real options, taking into account the uncertainties in REC prices, as evidenced in a study by Zeng [154]. The challenge in planning off-grid microgrids in developing countries, considering uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, underscores the necessity for innovative stochastic dynamic methods in investment planning, favoring multi-year over traditional single-year optimization strategies [45].

Addressing the uncertainty in solar power projects, advanced numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method have been developed. This approach integrates option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, emphasizing the significance of determining the optimal timing for project initiation [75]. The need for a decision-making framework that accounts for the optimal timing of investment under demand uncertainties in residential photovoltaic investments is also highlighted, utilizing the Real Option Method to explore various investment strategies for maximizing long-term benefits [160].

The decision to invest in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory stresses the importance of accurate financial valuation models, particularly when considering the installation of PV technologies at an optimal future time [102]. Moreover, determining the optimal timing for the installation of building-integrated PV systems becomes a critical decision-making aspect under price uncertainties, adding an additional layer of managerial flexibility [89]. The development of an innovation diffusion model for renewable energy deployment, integrating agent-based modeling and real options, reveals the influence of individual risk preferences and social networks on renewable energy investment decisions, offering valuable insights for policy recommendations to stimulate the PV market [26]. Assessing the demand response value in PV systems based on real options theory further underlines the increasing relevance of environmental considerations in investment decisions [111]. Finally, evaluating defer and relocation options in PV generation investments through stochastic simulation-based methods underscores the importance of risk management and strategic flexibility in electricity markets, advocating for appropriate methodologies to assess the economic value of PV power plants under uncertainties [3].

Collectively, these records underscore the critical importance of considering uncertainties and managerial flexibility in making informed and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector, particularly focusing on solar PV power generation.

RENEWABLE_ENERGY is getting more IMPORTANT_NOWADAYS as an alternative to
TRADITIONAL_ENERGIES. SOLAR_ENERGY, according to ENERGY_MARKET_AUTHORITY,
is the most viable in the context of SINGAPORE compared to other
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES due to land constraints. in light of the
increasing adoption of SOLAR_POWER in SINGAPORE, this PAPER_FOCUSES on
SOLAR_PV leasing using a CASE_STUDY. this PAPER_ASSESSES the prospect for
SOLAR_PV LEASING_COMPANIES in SINGAPORE through the lens of embedded
REAL_OPTIONS. the RECENT_NEWS that SOLAR_POWER is becoming the
CHEAPEST_FORM of NEW_ELECTRICITY presents the leasing company an option
to expand the scale of SOLAR_PV_SYSTEM. taking into account this option,
the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) of the INVESTMENT increased significantly
compared to the case without REAL_OPTIONS.
TECHNOLOGICAL_DEVELOPMENTS_RESULT in a continuously CHANGING_ENVIRONMENT
with uncertainties. thus, DECISION_MAKERS_NEED to be aware of the
INHERENT_RISK associated and IDENTIFY_OPTIONS to MAXIMIZE_NPV. this
UPSIDE_POTENTIAL is realized by exercising the MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY and
exploiting the UNCERTAINTY. the paper enables SOLAR_ENERGY_PLANNERS to
consider POSSIBLE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITIES under uncertainties, showing
how option thinking can be incorporated in the VALUATION of SOLAR_ENERGY.

Title: ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS of ELECTRICITY_STORAGE based on HEAT_PUMPS and
THERMAL_STORAGE_UNITS in LARGE_SCALE thermal POWER_PLANTS
Abstract:
```
in this paper the FINANCIAL_VIABILITY of a NOVEL_STORAGE_CONCEPT,
referred to as 'integrated pumped_heat_electricity storage', is assessed
for both a coal_fired and a combined cycle (cc) POWER_PLANT located in
GERMANY, as well as for a concentrated SOLAR_POWER (csp) plant located in
spain. the rationale of this concept is to use ELECTRICITY during times
of CHEAP_WHOLESALE_MARKET_PRICES, e.g. stemming from a high supply of
RENEWABLE_ENERGIES, in order to GENERATE_THERMAL_ENERGY via a HEAT_PUMP,
since THERMAL_ENERGY can be stored at comparatively low COST. if the
ELECTRICITY_DEMAND_RISES again, the stored THERMAL_ENERGY is used to
power a conventional water_steam cycle, thereby reducing the amount of
FOSSIL_FUELS used or enlarging the operating time of a CSP_PLANT. a mixed
INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAM, considering the day_ahead
WHOLESALE_MARKET_ELECTRICITY_PRICES and remunerations of
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER in GERMANY, is employed to find an
approximation of the OPTIMAL_SCHEDULE for the generation in the
POWER_PLANT as well as for the purchase and the sale of ELECTRICITY. the
FINANCIAL_VIABILITY is assessed using net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) and
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS. storing ELECTRICITY to profit from
TEMPORAL_ARBITRAGE is found to be unprofitable, since the (conservatively
estimated) COSTS of THERMAL_STORAGE_UNITS are still too high. the largest
part of the revenues stems from the remunerations of
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER. therefore, while the utilization of
HEAT_PUMPS, which are estimated to have rather HIGH_COSTS, is not
profitable, employing ELECTRIC_HEATERS without STORAGE_UNITS is found to
be economically viable for a coal_fired and a CC_POWER_PLANT in GERMANY.
here, NPV and REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS_YIELD the same result, i.e. to invest
immediately in such an application. in spain,
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER is presently not remunerated, but only
the call_offs of TERTIARY_CONTROL_ENERGY, which are not considered in the
mixed INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAM. consequently, employing ELECTRIC_HEATERS in
CSP_PLANTS in spain is found to be not financially viable either.  2017

BOT_SOLAR_PV_POWER_PROJECT under POLICY_INCENTIVES by considering the
value of the option to defer. in the proposed model, an
EFFECTIVE_INTERVAL of CONCESSION_PERIOD for the BOT_PROJECT was
identified by using a REAL_OPTION, and the EQUILIBRIUM_VALUE of the
CONCESSION_PERIOD was obtained by applying CLASSICAL_OPTIMIZATION_THEORY.
to evaluate our model, we empirically determined the
OPTIMAL_CONCESSION_PERIOD for the BOT_SOLAR_PV_POWER_PROJECT in CHINA,
and a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS was conducted to demonstrate how
RELEVANT_INFLUENTIAL_FACTORS, which are presented in the model, affect
the EQUILIBRIUM_VALUE of the CONCESSION_PERIOD and its
EFFECTIVE_INTERVAL. the results indicate that the
CURRENT_INVESTMENT_ENVIRONMENT in CHINA could successfully implement the
BOT_SOLAR_PV_POWER_PROJECT under POLICY_INCENTIVES, including
INITIAL_COST_SUBSIDY and the feed_in tariffs mechanism. while the
HIGH_VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY_DEMAND, INVESTMENT_COST, and land_use rent
fee can lead the failure of the BOT_SOLAR_PV_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION,
promoting the TECHNOLOGICAL_DEVELOPMENT of PV_POWER_GENERATION,
maintaining the MARKET_STABILITY, and increasing the POLICY_INCENTIVES
can help the BOT_POWER_PROJECT to be arranged with an
OPTIMAL_CONCESSION_PERIOD. in addition, the feed_in tariffs mechanism is
more helpful than the INITIAL_COST_SUBSIDY for winning the BOT_CONTRACT.

Title: EVALUATION of the value of the FLEXIBILITY offered by ON_ORBIT_SERVICING:
case of SATELLITE_UPGRADE
Abstract:
```
SPACE_SYSTEMS are characterized by a LARGE_INITIAL_INVESTMENT and 15_20
YEAR_DESIGN_LIFETIME to increase the RETURN_ON_INVESTMENT. no
MAINTENANCE_CAPABILITY is available for most SPACE_SYSTEMS. therefore,
the TRADITIONAL_APPROACH adopted by SPACE_SYSTEMS_OPERATORS is to
build_in reliability in the satellite and to replace the system in case
of OBSOLESCENCE or failure. this lack of FLEXIBILITY may translate to
RISK for the operator such as RISK of SYSTEM_FAILURE, RISK of
TECHNOLOGY_OBSOLESCENCE, RISK of COMMERCIAL_OBSOLESCENCE for
COMMERCIAL_MISSIONS or RISK of a CHANGE_IN_REQUIREMENTS. autonomous
on_orbit servicing can change this paradigm and bring FLEXIBILITY to
SPACE_SYSTEMS. the case of SATELLITE_UPGRADE using on_orbit servicing is
investigated in the PARTICULAR_EXAMPLE of COMMERCIAL_MISSIONS. a
DYNAMIC_FRAMEWORK, based on REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY, is used to account for
the FLEXIBILITY offered by on_orbit servicing. the case of a
COMMERCIAL_MISSION under UNCERTAIN_REVENUES is first studied. the effect
of the upgrade on the REVENUE_STREAM and the VOLATILITY of the MARKET are
two MAJOR_PARAMETERS. the value of the FLEXIBILITY can be a
SIGNIFICANT_PART of the TOTAL_VALUE of the project, emphasizing the
importance of DYNAMIC_VALUATION_TECHNIQUES rather than
CONVENTIONAL_VALUATION_TECHNIQUES such as net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV). the
case of a GEOSYNCHRONOUS_EARTH_ORBIT (geo) COMMUNICATION_SATELLITE facing
UNCERTAIN_DEMAND with a limited capacity is presented as a more
SPECIFIC_EXAMPLE. upgrading the SOLAR_PANELS would restore the power
level on_board the satellite, thus allowing to increase the
SATELLITE_CAPACITY. three options are embedded in this case: the option
to replace, to service and to abandon the mission. results on the value
of the option to abandon are presented for a

Title: INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY and its application to
SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS
Abstract:
```
CONVENTIONAL_METHODS used in PROJECT_EVALUATION have a STATIC_NATURE,
which cause DECISION_MAKERS to examine INVESTMENT_PROJECTS within a
NARROW_SCOPE. as an alternative, real_options theory allows
DECISION_MAKERS to use the concepts of UNCERTAINTY and
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, which CLASSICAL_METHODS do not deal with, in
valuing INVESTMENT_PROJECTS. carlsson and fullers fuzzy real_options
theory has been a solution for situations where CASH_FLOW and
COST_VARIABLES used in the model cannot be expressed by using
CLASSICAL_NUMBERS but by using FUZZY_NUMBERS. the idea of using
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS in REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY can expand the
NARROW_SCOPE more effectively than the idea of using classical
real_options theory, thereby providing an opportunity to evaluate
INVESTMENT_PROJECTS from a wider perspective. in this study,
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY real_option VALUATION model has been developed and
applied to the EVALUATION of SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS. studies
have shown that SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS that do not seem profitable
today in turkey can perform profitably in the FUTURE. moreover, the
HISTORICAL_VOLATILITY_MODEL_DIFFERS from the expected VALUABLE_MODELS,

Title: BUSINESS_VALUATION_STRATEGY for NEW_HYDROPONIC_FARM_DEVELOPMENT  a
proposal towards SUSTAINABLE_AGRICULTURE_DEVELOPMENT in united
ARAB_EMIRATES
Abstract:
```
purpose: this STUDY_AIMS to evaluate a HYDROPONIC_FARM (through
NUTRIENT_FILM_TECHNIQUE) while considering UNCERTAINTY, SUSTAINABILITY
and the system's utility in the DOMINANT_DESERT_GEOGRAPHY. the idea of
the HYDROPONIC_FARM is to allow individuals/businesses to grow plants.
given the GEOGRAPHICAL_CONDITION, the HYDROPONIC_SYSTEM may be useful in
the GULF_CONTEXT and may lead to FOOD_SECURITY and SUSTAINABILITY.
additionally, the UAE_GOVERNMENT has initiated several SUPPORT_SCHEMES
that can be availed for investing in SUCH_BUSINESSES that can contribute
to the nation's FOOD_SECURITY. DESIGN/methodology/approach: the
HYDROPONIC_FARM is evaluated using the net PRESENT_VALUE and
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH. the authors studied five scenarios: 1. business as
usual, 2. 50% SUBSIDY on INITIAL_INVESTMENT through khalifa FUNDING, 3.
4% premium, 4. SUBSIDY plus premium and 5. SOLAR_PANEL installation with
bore well. findings: as per the assumptions and DATA_USAGE, all the
SCENARIOS_SHOWS a POSITIVE_NET PRESENT_VALUE (NPV); nevertheless,
scenarios 4 and 5 report the significant highest net present and
DELAY_VALUE. RESEARCH limitations/implications: this study has
environmental, economic and SOCIAL_IMPLICATIONS. lower IMPORTS indirectly
lead to lower CARBON_FOOTPRINTS. the LOCAL_PRODUCTION of FOOD_ENSURES
higher EMPLOYABILITY in the sector and increase in LOCAL_CONSUMPTION.
additionally, FRESH_FOOD_CONSUMPTION is directly associated to
GOOD_HEALTH. PRACTICAL_IMPLICATIONS: SUPPORTIVE_POLICIES such as
subsidies through khalifa FUNDING may accelerate the expansion of
SUCH_PROJECTS through domestic and FOREIGN_INVESTMENTS. one of the
IMPORTANT_TAKEAWAY from the study is to invest in the training of the
WORKFORCE. SOCIAL_IMPLICATIONS: given the GEOGRAPHICAL_CONDITION, the uae
usually depends on FOOD_IMPORTS. if the HYDROPONIC_FARMS become popular,
the residents will have access to FRESH_VEGETABLES and fruits. higher
engagement in AGRICULTURE_ACTIVITIES also ensures a SIGNIFICANT_INCREASE
in agriculture_related businesses and higher EMPLOYABILITY.
originality/value: the study adds novelty to the literature because the
effect of khalifa FUNDING and INVESTMENT_ANALYSIS on SOLAR (wells) has
not been evaluated in any HYDROPONIC_STUDIES. we presented the results
with TORNADO_GRAPHS using NPV_RISK and REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH in the
GULF_CONTEXT. the study represents FUNCTIONAL_SCENARIOS that were
previously not found in the literature.  2020, emerald publishing

The domain of renewable energy investments, especially in solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, has become increasingly complex due to uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements. Real Options Analysis (ROA) offers a refined approach to these investments, providing the necessary flexibility to adapt to these uncertainties. For instance, in China, the integration of the American Option Method with a learning curve method demonstrated that ROA was more effective than traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in navigating uncertainties in renewable energy policies, emphasizing the critical balance between government and investor interests [149]. The volatile PV market in Italy, influenced by changing government incentives, highlighted how uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs could significantly delay optimal investment decisions, as evaluated through a real option approach [130].

In the UK, the attractiveness of domestic PV systems was enhanced by the application of real options theory, which provides a strategy to defer investment in response to rapid technological developments [133]. A comparative study on investments in solar and wind energy using ROA indicated that learning rates significantly impact investment decisions, suggesting that under certain conditions, focusing on a single technology might be more advantageous than diversification [33]. Furthermore, the valuation of PV power investments in existing buildings, considering uncertainties in tariffs, technology costs, and regulatory policies, highlighted the importance of combining ROA with stochastic simulation. This approach indicated that while standard appraisal methods might initially dismiss rooftop PV projects, the option valuation method supports maintaining these investment opportunities for future reassessment [97].

The uncertainty related to Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) plays a significant role in investment decisions in distributed solar generation. Optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments is essential, and can be effectively modeled as real options that account for uncertainties in REC prices, as shown in a study by Zeng [154]. The complexity of planning off-grid microgrids in developing countries, considering uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, underscores the need for innovative stochastic dynamic methods in investment planning, favoring multi-year optimization strategies over traditional single-year methods [45].

Addressing the uncertainty in solar power project investments, advanced numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method have been developed. This method integrates option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of determining the optimal timing for project initiation [75]. The need for a decision-making framework that accounts for the optimal timing of investment under demand uncertainties in residential photovoltaic investments is also highlighted, using the Real Option Method to explore various investment strategies for long-term gains [160].

The consideration of investing in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory stresses the need for precise financial valuation models, especially when considering the installation of PV technologies at an optimal future time [102]. Determining the optimal timing for installing building-integrated PV systems becomes crucial under price uncertainties, adding an additional layer of managerial flexibility to investment decisions [89]. The development of an innovation diffusion model for renewable energy deployment, incorporating agent-based modeling and real options, demonstrates the impact of individual risk preferences and social networks on renewable energy investment decisions, providing valuable insights for policy recommendations to stimulate the PV market [26]. Assessing the demand response value in PV systems based on real options theory further emphasizes the growing importance of environmental considerations in investment decisions [111]. Lastly, evaluating defer and relocation options in PV generation investments through stochastic simulation-based methods highlights the importance of risk management and strategic flexibility in electricity markets, advocating for suitable methodologies to assess the economic value of PV power plants under uncertainties [3].

These records collectively highlight the importance of considering uncertainties and managerial flexibility in making informed and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector, with a special focus on solar PV power generation.

Title: REAL_OPTION_THEORY_COMPLEMENTS the stage and GATE_PROCESS: the value of
INFORMATION_INFORMATION
Abstract:
```
phased PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_PROCESSES, also known as stage and
GATE_MANAGEMENT_PROCESSES (sgmp), are widely used to macro and
micro_manage projects from EARLY_EVALUATION, to sanctioning and close
out. these tools tend to disassemble by discipline the activities and
decisions disseminated along the life of a project and re_bundle them
into standardized SEQUENTIAL_PHASES, with the underlying intention to
narrow down uncertainties and multiply the PROJECT_VALUE. by virtue of
the IMPLICIT_SET of routines and checks, sgmps have successfully brought
a great deal of discipline in the allocation of HUMAN and
FINANCIAL_CAPITAL among competing prospects _ albeit not enough.
UNCERTAINTY is the scapegoat our industry too often resorts to to justify
otherwise INEXPLICABLE_FAILURES. the variability embedded in the oil and
GAS_BUSINESS (nature, RAW_MATERIALS_PRICES, etc.) undeniably plays to the
detriment of our industry's bottom line but it is not the only delinquent
in the game. ultimately, opportunities are passed over on account of
INAPPROPRIATE_ASSESSMENT of the value of UNCERTAINTY and of acquiring the
information (VALUE_OF_INFORMATION, voi) necessary to narrow it down.
finance_derived REAL_OPTIONS have long been proposed to guide
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS and overcome the limitations of npv_based
approaches. however, REAL_OPTIONS have failed to win proselytes because
of UNDENIABLE_MATHEMATICAL_COMPLICATION and an ill_fated fame to be too
volatile a concept to fit into 150_year OLD_OIL and GAS_INDUSTRY. a
NOVEL_APPROACH is presented that complements the structured framework of
sgmps with VOI_EVALUATION. the result is a PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TOOL that
preserves the merits of sgmps while warranting improved
FINANCIAL_DISCIPLINE. copyright 2008, society of PETROLEUM_ENGINEERS.

Title: deferring REAL_OPTIONS with SOLAR RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES
Abstract:
```
this STUDY_EVALUATES_INVESTMENT in a utility_scale SOLAR_POWER_PLANT
using a real_options approach (ROA). although roas have been widely
applied in the literature, the deferring option for a utility_scale
POWER_PLANT has not been fully examined, especially within the context of
the UNIQUE_SUBSIDY_PROGRAM of SOLAR RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES (srecs)
in the usa. using data from one of the most developed
SOLAR_ELECTRICITY_MARKETS in NEW_JERSEY, we incorporate the time_varying
VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY_PRICES and bounded SREC_PRICES in real_options
VALUATION. our results show that deferring REAL_OPTIONS generates
SIGNIFICANT_VALUE for the project that the
TRADITIONAL_DISCOUNT_CASH_FLOW_APPROACH_IGNORES. it is thus optimal to
postpone the INVESTMENT in more than 70% of cases. in addition, we
demonstrate that debt FINANCING is crucial for

SOLAR_ENERGY_PROJECTS_CONTRIBUTE to SMART_CITY_GOALS by reducing

projects, characterised by their SEQUENTIAL_NATURE, require a HUGE_AMOUNT
of IRREVERSIBLE_INVESTMENT, especially in the case of large_scale
PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS (mw). this aspect could make
SOLAR_PROJECTS_UNATTRACTIVE for POTENTIAL_INVESTORS. to mitigate the
RISKS of FINANCIAL_LOSSES the investor could invest in small_scale
SOLAR_PROJECTS and switch to large_scale INVESTMENT_PROJECTS only if the
MARKET_CONDITIONS are favourable. this PAPER_AIMS to embed this
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY of changing INVESTMENT_SIZE during the
PROJECT_LIFETIME into its VALUATION. to accomplish this, we use a
COMPOUND_OPTIONS_APPROACH with a switch and call OPTIONS_MODELS to
reliably price these projects by considering their riskiness and, their
stochastic and multi_stage nature. we also consider the determination of
the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME like an AMERICAN_OPTION. we also propose a
CASE_STUDY that shows that considering the MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY_VALUE
in the PROJECT_VALUATION makes them attractive and financially

Title: the VOLATILITY of INDUSTRIAL_PROJECTS for use in analysis of RISK in
INVESTMENTS;
Abstract:
```
the VOLATILITY concerning INDUSTRIAL_PROJECTS is a SIGNIFICANT_PARAMETER
in the analysis of RISK in INVESTMENTS. when FINANCIAL_ASSETS are
evaluated, the VOLATILITY can be determined by HISTORICAL_DATA of ASSETS.
however, when working with INDUSTRIAL_PROJECTS, usually, there are no
HISTORICAL_DATA, which makes VOLATILITY a CRITICAL_PARAMETER to be
determined. the objective of this study is the adoption and comparison of
three approaches to determine PROJECT_VOLATILITY in a
TRANSFORMATION_INDUSTRY. two of the adopted approaches, the "consolidated
VOLATILITY_APPROACH of copeland and antikarov (2001)" and the "estimated
VOLATILITY of herath and park (2002)" were obtained from a
LITERATURE_REVIEW of methods for calculation of VOLATILITY of
INVESTMENT_PROJECTS. the third approach is a NEW_PROPOSAL for
VOLATILITY_CALCULATION entitled: "the estimate of VOLATILITY through the
dependence between PV_O and PV". a TRADITIONAL_ANALYSIS of INVESTMENTS in
an INDUSTRIAL_PROJECT was performed, in which these three
DIFFERENT_APPROACHES for determination of VOLATILITY were adopted.
lastly, a comparison of the three approaches is presented, in which the
difference between the highest and the lowest VOLATILITY_VALUES is
nineteen PERCENTILE_POINTS.

In the complex and evolving field of renewable energy investments, particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, the challenges presented by uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements necessitate an advanced and flexible approach to investment decision-making. Real Options Analysis (ROA) stands out as a strategic tool in this context, enabling investors to make informed decisions amid these uncertainties. For example, in China, the combination of the American Option Method with a learning curve approach revealed ROA's effectiveness over traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in addressing uncertainties in renewable energy policies, thus highlighting the essential balance between government and investor interests [149]. In Italy, the dynamic nature of the PV market, influenced by fluctuating government incentives, illustrated how uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs could significantly delay optimal investment decisions, as assessed through a real option approach [130].

In the UK, the adoption of real options theory improved the viability of domestic PV systems, offering a strategic pathway to defer investment in response to rapid technological changes [133]. A comparative study involving solar and wind energy investments using ROA indicated that learning rates have a substantial impact on investment decisions. This suggests that under specific conditions, a concentrated investment in a single technology may be more advantageous than diversifying investments [33]. Furthermore, the assessment of PV power investments in existing buildings, taking into account uncertainties in tariffs, technology costs, and regulatory policies, underscored the importance of integrating ROA with stochastic simulation. This approach showed that while standard appraisal methods might initially dismiss rooftop PV projects, option valuation methods recommend preserving these investment opportunities for future reassessment [97].

The role of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) in investment decisions in distributed solar generation is significant. Optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments is crucial and can be modeled effectively as real options, incorporating uncertainties in REC prices, as demonstrated in the study by Zeng [154]. The challenges in designing off-grid microgrids in developing countries, with uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, highlight the necessity for innovative stochastic dynamic methods in investment planning, preferring multi-year optimization strategies over traditional single-year methods [45].

The uncertainty in solar power project investments is being addressed with sophisticated numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method. This method combines option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of identifying the optimal timing for project initiation [75]. The need for a decision-making framework that considers the optimal timing of investment under demand uncertainties in residential photovoltaic investments is also emphasized, employing the Real Option Method to analyze different investment strategies for long-term benefits [160].

Investing in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory underscores the requirement for accurate financial valuation models, particularly when considering the future installation of PV technologies [102]. Determining the optimal timing for installing building-integrated PV systems is vital under price uncertainties, adding a layer of managerial flexibility to investment decisions [89]. The creation of an innovation diffusion model for renewable energy deployment, integrating agent-based modeling with real options, shows the influence of individual risk preferences and social networks on renewable energy investment decisions, providing valuable insights for policy recommendations to stimulate the PV market [26]. Assessing the value of demand response in PV systems based on real options theory further highlights the increasing importance of environmental factors in investment decisions [111]. Finally, evaluating defer and relocation options in PV generation investments through stochastic simulation-based methods underlines the importance of risk management and strategic flexibility in electricity markets, calling for suitable methodologies to assess the economic value of PV power plants under uncertainties [3].

Overall, these records collectively emphasize the significance of considering uncertainties and managerial flexibility in making informed and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector, particularly focusing on solar PV power generation.

Title: the impact of some REAL_OPTIONS on the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER of portfolios
of OIL_PRODUCTION_PROJECTS
Abstract:
```
the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER of portfolios is an IMPORTANT_TOOL for MANAGEMENT
because decision_makers can see how much return can be achieved using the
TOTAL_ASSETS of the corporation and at the same time the level of RISK.
but, in order to create the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER, each PROJECT_NEED to be
analyzed previously _ CAPITAL_INVESTMENT, PRODUCTION_PROFILE,
CAPITAL_COST_ETC. at the level of projects usually there are many
REAL_OPTIONS available for MANAGEMENT over the life of the project _
drill ADDITIONAL_WELLS, develop a SATELLITE_OIL & GAS_FIELD,
OIL_PRODUCTION, make farm_out etc. when properly used, these REAL_OPTIONS
have value and are an IMPORTANT_TOOL for reducing the RISK of NPV. then,
a more REALISTIC_EFFICIENT_FRONTIER should consider the value of these
REAL_OPTIONS, but in the practice of oil and GAS_BUSINESS this does not
always occur. in this paper, the study of the impact of some REAL_OPTIONS
on the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER of portfolios intends to use an integrated
methodology including REAL_OPTIONS, PORTFOLIO_THEORY and
MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION. three deep_water OIL_PROJECTS are combined in a
portfolio, where the decisor has an option to sell the project if the
PAYBACK_PERIOD is not accomplished. for the case of
HYPOTHETICAL_SITUATION, PRELIMINARY_RESULTS indicated when there is
availability of REAL_OPTIONS and MANAGEMENT that can use them optimally,
there are two MAIN_CONSEQUENCES: 1) the distribution of NPV is moved to
the right and the EFFICIENT_FRONTIER is displaced towards more return and
RISK is reduced; 2) this way of thinking is important in order to a more
EFFECTIVE_POLICY for managing those variables that
GENERATE_SYSTEMATIC_RISKS (price, geology, etc). this model gives a
better view of the TRUE_VALUE of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITIES in the context
not only of projects, but on the portfolio that is much more realistic.

the use of residential photovoltaic_storage systems may produce
LARGE_BENEFITS to owners and has expanded rapidly in RECENT_YEARS.
nonetheless, LARGE_UNCERTAINTIES regarding the PROFITABILITY of these

COMPOUND_FLEXIBILITY of both the option of delaying INVESTMENTS and the
option of further expanding the capacity of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_MODULES
and BATTERIES during the INVESTMENT_HORIZON. FLEXIBILITY is modeled as a
compound REAL_OPTION, whose value is computed using a NOVEL_METHOD that
we call compound least SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO (clsm). the model is applied
to the INVESTMENT_DECISIONS associated to a residential
photovoltaic_storage system. results suggest that investors should use
the proposed CLSM_METHOD in the ECONOMIC_VALUATION of multi_stage
projects, since considering only a single FLEXIBILITY could promote
sub_optimal decisions. moreover, in our CASE_STUDY, we show that it is

introduced with the usage of FUZZY_LOGIC. FUZZY_LOGIC is applied by
binomial and black_scholes REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_METHODS up to date, but
not with the TRINOMIAL_LATTICE. moreover, types_1 and 2 FUZZY_NUMBERS are
used; however, the INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS are not analyzed in
detail in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION. in this ARTICLE, we propose an
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_TRINOMIAL_LATTICE REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_MODEL for a
SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECT. while valuing the DEFERMENT_OPTION,
EXPERT_OPINIONS, two DIFFERENT_VOLATILITY_METHODS, and a tailor_made
ELECTRICITY price_forecasting model are used. according to our results,
the DEFERMENT_OPTION is valuable and delaying the start of the project
provides a much higher expanded net PRESENT_VALUE than an
IMMEDIATE_START. the contribution of this ARTICLE is that the UNCERTAINTY
in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION is modeled from a BROADER_PERSPECTIVE with
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS by taking the hesitancy of the
decision_maker and the MARKET into account. consequently, the proposed
method would increase the accuracy of the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION in
UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTS such as RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SECTOR.   1988_2012 ieee.

Title: VALUATION of WIND ENERGY_TURBINES using VOLATILITY of WIND and price
Abstract:
```
the limitedness of the NONRENEWABLE_LOCAL_ENERGY_RESOURCES in israel,
even in the background of the later GAS_FIELDS_FINDINGS, continues to
force the state to devote VARIOUS_EFFORTS towards
GREEN_ENERGY_DEVELOPMENT. these efforts include installations, both for
the SOLAR and for WIND_ENERGY, thus improving the diversity of
ENERGY_SOURCES. while the standard discounted CASH_FLOW (dcf) method
using the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) criterion is extensively adopted to
evaluate INVESTMENTS, the STANDARD_DCF_METHOD is inappropriate for the
rapidly changing INVESTMENT_CLIMATE and for the MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY in
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. in RECENT_YEARS, the REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA)
technique has been widely applied in many studies for the VALUATION of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS. taking into account the
ABOVE_BACKGROUND, we apply, in this study, the
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS_APPROACH for the VALUATION of WIND ENERGY_TURBINES
and apply it to the analysis of WIND_ENERGY ECONOMIC_POTENTIAL in israel,
which is the context of our work. we hypothesize that due to nature of
WIND ENERGY_PRODUCTION_UNCERTAINTIES, the ROA_METHOD is better than the
alternative. the novelty of this paper includes the following: REAL_WORLD
WIND statistics of the MEROM_GOLAN_SITE in israel (velocity 3.73 m/s,
with a STANDARD_DEVIATION of 2.03 m/s), a
REALISTIC_POWER_GENERATION_ESTIMATION (POWER_GENERATION of 1205.84 kw
with a STANDARD_DEVIATION of about 0.5% in ANNUAL_VALUE which is worth
about 1.3 m$ per annum), and an ECONOMIC_MODEL to evaluate the
PROFITABILITY of such a project. we thus discuss the existing challenges
of diversifying RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES in israel by adding WIND
installations. our motivation is to introduce a method which will allow
investors and officials to take into ACCOUNT_UNCERTAINTIES when deciding
in investing in SUCH_WIND_INSTALLATIONS. the outcomes of the paper, which
are obtained using the method of WEIBULL_STATISTICS and the
BLACKSCHOLES_ROA_TECHNIQUE, include the result that
MARKET_PRICE_VOLATILITY adds to the uncertainties much more than any WIND
fluctuations, provided that the analysis is integrated over a long enough
time.  2021 by the authors. LICENSEE_MDPI, basel, switzerland.

In the domain of renewable energy investments, especially solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, addressing the complexities arising from uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements is critical. Real Options Analysis (ROA) provides a strategic framework for these investment decisions, offering the necessary flexibility to navigate these uncertainties. For instance, in China, the integration of the American Option Method with a learning curve methodology showed that ROA outperforms traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in managing uncertainties in renewable energy policies, emphasizing the need for a balance between government and investor interests [149]. The fluctuating PV market in Italy, driven by varying government incentives, highlighted how uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs could lead to significant delays in making optimal investment decisions, as evaluated through real option approaches [130].

In the UK, the implementation of real options theory has enhanced the attractiveness of domestic PV systems, providing a strategic option to defer investment in light of rapid technological advancements [133]. A comparative analysis between solar and wind energy investments using ROA revealed that learning rates are a critical factor in investment decisions. This implies that under certain conditions, focusing on a single technology might be more beneficial than diversification [33]. Additionally, the valuation of PV power investments in existing buildings, which involves uncertainties in tariffs, technology costs, and regulatory policies, highlighted the benefits of combining ROA with stochastic simulation. This method suggests that while standard appraisal techniques might overlook rooftop PV projects initially, the option valuation approach advocates for retaining these investment opportunities for future reassessment [97].

The uncertainty associated with Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) significantly influences investment decisions in distributed solar generation. Optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments is crucial, and can be modeled as real options, taking into account the uncertainties in REC prices, as demonstrated by Zeng [154]. The challenge of designing off-grid microgrids in developing countries, with the uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, underlines the importance of innovative stochastic dynamic methods in investment planning, advocating for multi-year optimization strategies over traditional single-year methods [45].

Advanced numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method have been developed to address the uncertainty in solar power project investments. This method integrates option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, highlighting the significance of determining the optimal timing for project initiation [75]. The need for a decision-making framework that incorporates the optimal timing of investment under demand uncertainties in residential photovoltaic investments is also emphasized, using the Real Option Method to explore various investment strategies for maximizing long-term benefits [160].

Investing in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory underlines the need for precise financial valuation models, particularly when considering future installations of PV technologies [102]. Determining the optimal timing for installing building-integrated PV systems becomes a key decision-making aspect under price uncertainties, adding another layer of managerial flexibility [89]. The development of an innovation diffusion model for renewable energy deployment, integrating agent-based modeling with real options, illustrates the impact of individual risk preferences and social networks on renewable energy investment decisions, offering valuable insights for policy recommendations to enhance the PV market [26]. Evaluating the demand response value in PV systems based on real options theory further emphasizes the growing relevance of environmental factors in investment decisions [111]. Lastly, assessing defer and relocation options in PV generation investments through stochastic simulation-based methods accentuates the importance of risk management and strategic flexibility in electricity markets, promoting suitable methodologies for evaluating the economic value of PV power plants under uncertainties [3].

These records collectively underscore the critical importance of considering uncertainties and managerial flexibility in making informed and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector, with a particular focus on solar PV power generation.

Title: a REAL_OPTIONS_METHODOLOGY for evaluating RISK and opportunity of
NATURAL_VENTILATION
Abstract:
```
the variable, UNCERTAIN_NATURE of climate imposes RISK in using SOLAR and
BUILDING_TECHNOLOGIES, such as NATURAL_VENTILATION (nv). to maximize the
POTENTIAL_BENEFIT from nv while reducing RISK, a building could be
designed for nv along with the "REAL_OPTION" to install
MECHANICAL_COOLING in the FUTURE, if needed.
TRADITIONAL_EVALUATION_PROCEDURES use EXPECTED_VALUES, which fail to
acknowledge the value of UNCERTAINTY when SYSTEM_PERFORMANCE is a
non_linear function of the uncertain variable. a REAL_OPTIONS_METHODOLOGY
is proposed to evaluate the FLEXIBLE_BUILDING_DESIGN under
CLIMATE_UNCERTAINTY. a building ENERGY_SIMULATION is used to obtain
PROBABILITY_DISTRIBUTIONS of the COST_SAVINGS of the option_based
NV_STRATEGY and of the time when (if) the MECHANICAL_COOLING system is
installed. a simplified STOCHASTIC_TEMPERATURE_GENERATOR is used, and it
may be used to evaluate REAL_OPTIONS for other technologies sensitive to
FUTURE_CLIMATE. the results of a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS provide
information to project investors on a) the likelihood of exercising the
option, and b) the improved FINANCIAL_VALUE of the TECHNOLOGY when
implemented with a FLEXIBLE_STRATEGY. copyright  2005 by asme.

a CASE_STUDY in SOLAR_POWER_PLANTS of iran
Abstract:
```
nowadays, classic discounted CASH_FLOW (dcf) approach is mostly used in
order to evaluate VARIOUS_TYPES of projects. since projects in all around
the world are confronting with DIFFERENT_BARRIERS, such as HIGH_RISK,
VARIOUS_KINDS of UNCERTAINTY, the aforesaid CLASSIC_APPROACH cannot
correctly determine the value of projects. therefore, proposing practical
and EFFICIENT_APPROACHES in EVALUATION of project in
UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT has drawn the attention of researchers in
RECENT_YEARS. in this study, an EFFICIENT_APPROACH for valuing of
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS in iran with REAL_OPTIONS is proposed and
compared with the CLASSIC_DCF_APPROACH. in order to evaluate the assumed
REAL_OPTIONS, the BINOMIAL_TREE_METHOD is implemented. eventually,
TAGUCHI_DESIGN_EXPERIMENT is used to analyze the performance of
BINOMIAL_TREE and figure out how REAL_OPTIONS_PARAMETERS_EFFECT on the
value of project. the obtained results show that considering
abovementioned REAL_OPTIONS increases the value of project comparing to
the case with no REAL_OPTIONS (i.e. DCF_APPROACH). moreover, the ranking
of EFFECTIVE_FACTORS, PARTICIPATIONS_PERCENTAGE of each factors on

Title: HARD_COAL_PROJECT_VALUATION based on REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH:
multiplicative vs. ARITHMETIC_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS;
Abstract:
```
PRECISE_VALUATION of the ECONOMIC_EFFICIENCY of RISKY_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS
in the MINERAL_SECTOR has a DIRECT_IMPACT on the range of
FUTURE_INVESTMENTS. since the mid_90s, a number of enterprises have also
been giving increased attention to the VALUATION of
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY that cannot normally be estimated with classical
discounted CASH_FLOW (dcf) analysis. this has been the result of a
development in the REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) and the simplification of
its ALGORITHMS, most of which have been achieved through:  incorporating
LATTICE_MODELS,  introducing a single UNCERTAIN_PROJECT_PARAMETER
(GROSS_PRESENT_VALUE, PV) as an underlying instrument,  assuming that the
underlying asset follows the MULTIPLICATIVE_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS,
introducing the marketed ASSET_DISCLAIMER (mad) assumption.
unfortunately, in most cases, MODELS constructed on the abovementioned
assumptions and modifications are not consistent with REAL_PROJECTS. some
analysts recognize that PROJECT_PVS might not follow the
MULTIPLICATIVE_PROCESS, which could have a DIRECT_IMPACT on the
PROJECTS_VALUE. in order to improve the MAD_APPROACH, the paper proposes
a modified model where the MULTIPLICATIVE_TREE is replaced with an
additive one. in addition, methods of ADDITIVE_VOLATILITY_CALCULATION and
DIVIDEND_ADJUSTMENTS were suggested.  2016, POLSKA_AKADEMIA_NAUK. all

Title: VALUATION of MINERAL_PROJECT with FLEXIBILITY MAD_APPROACH vs.
CONSECUTIVE_STOCHASTIC_TREE;
Abstract:
```
for many YEARS, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) has been perceived as an
ATTRACTIVE_PROJECT_VALUATION alternative to the traditional discounted
CASH_FLOW_ANALYSIS (dcf). right now, one can see evidence of a growing
dispersion in the applicability of the method among VARIOUS_INDUSTRIES
(particularly MINERALS, COAL, gas and petroleum) and the banking sector.
this is because of its potential to VALUE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY
including possibilities for delaying INVESTMENTS or reformulating the
operating strategies of the company. the REAL_OPTION_APPROACH enables one
to calculate a projects FUNDAMENTAL_VALUE in approximating the MARKET
one. the basis of OPTION_THEORY is STOCHASTIC_MODELING of underlying
ASSETS _ the preferred, commonly used ROA_METHODOLOGY, introduced by
copeland and antikarov (2001), is called the mad (marketed
ASSET_DISCLAIMER) approach. it assumes that an underlying asset, which is
the (gross) PRESENT_VALUE of the project (PV), changes with time
according to the MULTIPLICATIVE_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS derived as
DISCRETE_BINOMIAL_APPROXIMATION of GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION (gbm). in
addition, the MAD_ASSUMES, that a TWIN_ASSET of the underlying instrument
is calculated in a COMMON_WAY_NET PRESENT_VALUE (NPV). the twin_asset
assumption fulfills the THEORETICAL_CRITERIA required for
FAIR_OPTION_VALUATION in no_arbitrage conditions. the
PAPER_DELIVERS_EMPIRICAL_ARGUMENTS arguing that indirect MODELING of pvs,
according to the STANDARD_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS, do not properly
REFLECT_REALITY. the calculations were based on the VALUATION of a
HARD_COAL_PROJECT with FLEXIBILITY _ the methodology has included
MULTIPLICATIVE_PRICE MODELING (that parameter has served as so called
REFERENTIAL_ASSET) and, consequently, built a CONSECUTIVE_PVS_TREE, where
RESPECTIVE_PRESENT_VALUES have been adjusted by REFERENTIAL_PRICE_LEVELS.
moreover, the paper has emphasized that the option_to_wait changes the
structure of PROJECTS_CASH_FLOW and PV_TREES, depending on the waiting
period. in conclusion, the arguments have been derived from the
consecutive MODELING of a PV_ASSET is more accurate than indirect
constructing of it in the MADS_MULTIPLICATIVE_MODE.  2015,

Title: a STATISTICAL_LEARNING_APPROACH to determine optimal sizing &

Abstract:
```
the problem of optimal sizing and INVESTMENT_TIMING for a portfolio of
gas_fired and PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) generation is presented and solved using
an optimization_ CLASSIFICATION_TECHNIQUE. it is assumed that the demand,
the prices of NATURAL_GAS, and PV_TECHNOLOGY are STOCHASTIC_PROCESSES.
our methodology takes advantage of decomposing the problem into two
sub_problems. first, the optimal sizing problem is solved using
DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING and most LIKELY_SOLUTIONS are identified as clusters.
then, the INVESTMENT_TIME_PROBLEM is formulated as a REAL_OPTION for each
cluster to determine OPTIMAL_TIMING. although the two_step OPTIMIZATION
approach can successfully close the loop between OPERATIONAL_DYNAMICS and
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS, we are also interested in discovering patterns in a
MULTIDIMENSIONAL_SPACE of INPUT_PARAMETERS that make a
CERTAIN_COMBINATION of ASSETS_OPTIMAL among dozens of DISCRETE_CHOICES.
on that note, by applying RECURSIVE_PARTITIONING ALGORITHM,
DECISION_TREES are developed to estimate the structure of solutions
rendered from OPTIMIZATION_MODELS by a rule_based system. despite the
HIGH_LEVEL of accuracy, the INITIAL_MODEL is biased in favor of highly
FREQUENT_CLUSTERS, and discards the OPTIMAL_CLUSTERS resulted from
EXTREME_MARKET_BEHAVIORS. value at RISK (var) is employed as a
RISK_MEASURE to demonstrate the ENHANCEMENT_RISK_PERFORMANCE. finally, in
order to investigate the robustness of the results, we conduct
EXTENSIVE_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS over DIFFERENT_PARAMETER_SETTINGS. the
proposed model can be thought of as a statistically OPTIMAL_SUMMARIZER of
OPTIMIZATION_MODELS that enables DECISION_MAKERS to have an insight into
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES according to characteristics of the
building and the long_term ENERGY_MARKET outlook.  2020 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: what are you waiting to invest in grid connected
RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAICS in california? a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
Abstract:
```
the purpose of this paper is to assess the OPTIMAL_CHOICE of an investor,
a TYPICAL_HOUSEHOLD in california, UNITED_STATES, in terms of whether to
invest or not, in a RESIDENTIAL_SCALE, grid_connected,
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM, aiming to obtain SAVINGS in their
MONTHLY_ELECTRIC_EXPENSES. if they invest, they shoulder a fixed
UPFRONT_COST but also accept UNCERTAIN_POTENTIAL_SAVINGS. if they do not
invest, they forego any POTENTIAL_SAVINGS. to assess this
IRREVERSIBLE_DECISION, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS is deployed to assess the
ACTUAL_BENEFIT for the HOUSEHOLD. this approach allows us to determine
whether to trigger the INVESTMENTS and the OPTIMAL_TIMING to do so. our
findings show it is optimal for our investor to invest in PHOTOVOLTAICS;
however, some delay might be advised depending on the
ENERGY_PRODUCTION_FACTOR of SPECIFIC_GEOGRAPHICAL_AREAS and the expected
USEFUL_LIFE of the EQUIPMENT. the results of this study also show that it
might be optimal to delay the INVESTMENT between 5.5 and 12 YEARS in some
areas, which is a drawback. our findings also show that subsidies and
other incentives do not seem to be a KEY_DRIVER in the above_mentioned
INVESTMENT_DECISION. this STUDY_CONTRIBUTES to the existing literature by
examining the present dynamic of residential grid_connected
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS in the most RELEVANT_MARKET for the UNITED_STATES
and by including an assessment of UNCERTAINTY in both ELECTRIC_RATES and
PHOTOVOLTAICS_PRICES, that accounts for seasonality, PRICE_ESCALATION and
PRICE_MANIPULATION.  2021 INFORMA_UK limited, trading as taylor &

In the dynamic and evolving landscape of renewable energy investments, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, the complexity due to uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements necessitates an advanced approach to investment decision-making. Real Options Analysis (ROA) offers a strategic framework for this, enabling investors to make more flexible decisions in the face of uncertainty. For example, in China, integrating the American Option Method with a learning curve approach showed that ROA outperforms traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in managing uncertainties in renewable energy policy, highlighting the importance of balancing government and investor interests [149]. The volatile PV market in Italy, influenced by variable government incentives, demonstrated how uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs could significantly delay optimal investment decisions, as assessed through real option approaches [130].

In the UK, the adoption of real options theory improved the viability of domestic PV systems by offering strategic options to defer investment due to rapid technological changes [133]. A comparative analysis of investments in solar and wind energy using ROA indicated that learning rates critically impact investment decisions, suggesting that under certain conditions, focusing on a single technology may be more advantageous than diversification [33]. The valuation of PV power investments in existing buildings, considering uncertainties in tariffs, technology costs, and regulatory policies, highlighted the benefits of integrating ROA with stochastic simulation, suggesting that while standard appraisal methods might initially overlook rooftop PV projects, option valuation methods support keeping these investment opportunities open for future reassessment [97].

The impact of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) on investment decisions in distributed solar generation is significant. Optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments is crucial, and can be effectively modeled as real options, incorporating uncertainties in REC prices, as shown by Zeng [154]. The challenges in designing off-grid microgrids in developing countries, amidst uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, underscore the need for advanced stochastic dynamic methods in investment planning, advocating for multi-year optimization strategies over traditional single-year methods [45].

Advanced numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method have been developed to address the uncertainty in solar power project investments. This method integrates option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of determining the optimal timing for project initiation [75]. The need for a decision-making framework that considers the optimal timing of investment under demand uncertainties in residential photovoltaic investments is also emphasized, using the Real Option Method to explore various investment strategies for long-term gains [160].

Investing in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory highlights the need for accurate financial valuation models, especially when considering future installations of PV technologies [102]. Determining the optimal timing for installing building-integrated PV systems is crucial under price uncertainties, adding a dimension of managerial flexibility [89]. The development of an innovation diffusion model for renewable energy deployment, integrating agent-based modeling with real options, illustrates the influence of individual risk preferences and social networks on renewable energy investment decisions, offering valuable insights for policy recommendations to enhance the PV market [26]. Evaluating the demand response value in PV systems based on real options theory further emphasizes the growing importance of environmental factors in investment decisions [111]. Lastly, assessing defer and relocation options in PV generation investments through stochastic simulation-based methods underlines the importance of risk management and strategic flexibility in electricity markets, advocating for suitable methodologies to evaluate the economic value of PV power plants under uncertainties [3].

These records collectively underscore the critical importance of considering uncertainties and managerial flexibility in making informed and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector, with a special focus on solar PV power generation.

Title: optimal structuring of INVESTMENTS in ELECTRICITY_GENERATION_PROJECTS in
COLOMBIA with non conventional ENERGY_SOURCES
Abstract:
```
taking FULL_ADVANTAGE of fiscal and ECONOMIC_INCENTIVES has become a
COMPLEX_PROCESS for investors, who must find the RIGHT_PORTFOLIO or
CAPITAL_STRUCTURE to obtain viable and COMPETITIVE_GENERATION_PROJECTS.
in this context, this paper proposes a methodology for the optimal
structuring of INVESTMENTS in non_conventional ENERGY_SOURCES (ncres)
considering fiscal and ECONOMIC_INCENTIVES. three methods were evaluated:
(1) LEVELIZED_COST_OF_ELECTRICITY (lcoe) combined with three
METAHEURISTIC_TECHNIQUES; (2) discounted CASH_FLOW (dcf) with
MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION and value at RISK (var); and (3) REAL_OPTIONS with
black and scholes. the proposed approach presents as the
MAIN_FINANCIAL_INDICATOR the GENERATION_COST (gc), as well as three other
FINANCIAL_INDICATORS, namely: net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV), value at RISK
(var) and net PRESENT_VALUE for REAL_OPTIONS (NPV (formula presented.)).
the propose approach allows for defining DIFFERENT_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIOS
from where an investor can choose; each of which minimizes the gc.
furthermore, the methodology can be adapted to countries with
DIFFERENT_POLICIES and FISCAL_INCENTIVES for the development of
NCRES_PROJECTS. the results show that for each metaheuristic, an
OPTIMAL_CAPITAL_STRUCTURE that MINIMIZES_GC is obtained; in this way, a
gc of 0.032 (usd/kwh) is achieved for SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY, with
a reduction of 49.2%, when TAX_INCENTIVES are considered.  2022 by the

Title: the value of investing in DOMESTIC_ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS
Abstract:
```
in this paper, we investigate whether INVESTMENTS in
BATTERY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS, coupled with existing PV_PLANTS, are profitable
in the phasing out of incentives. in detail, we analyze the
INVESTMENT_DECISION of a HOUSEHOLD, who has already invested in a
PV_PLANT and has to decide whether and when to invest in the adoption of
BATTERY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS (bss). we provide a REAL_OPTION_MODEL to
determine the value of the opportunity to invest and its OPTIMAL_TIMING.
the existing PV_PLANT gives the HOUSEHOLD the opportunity to invest in
BSS_ADOPTION, and this opportunity is analogous to a CALL_OPTION. our
findings show that NEGATIVE_NPV_INVESTMENTS may turn to be profitable if
the HOUSEHOLD optimally exercises the option to defer. the greater the
VOLATILITY of ENERGY_PRICES, the greater the OPTION_VALUE to defer, and
the greater the OPPORTUNITY_COST of waiting (i.e., the greater the
ENERGY_PRICES_DRIFT), the smaller the OPTION_VALUE to defer.  2020,

Title: ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS using a REAL_OPTION_MODEL in an EXPLORATORY_PROJECT
Abstract:
```
the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_THEORY is based on the concepts of the options
traded in STOCK_MARKETS applied to REAL_PROJECTS, where those are
considered options of INVESTMENT. the methodology enables the VALUATION
of a manager's FLEXIBILITY to adapt and review his estimates for
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS if MARKET or project's processes have any change.
REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_CONSIDERS_FLEXIBILITY caused by uncertainties as a
KEY_POINT of an ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS of an INVESTMENT. this paper intends to
develop a REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_MODEL to be applied in
INVESTMENT_OPPORTUNITIES where uncertainties related to the
INITIAL_PRODUCTION_RATE and the DECLINE_RATE are KEY_VARIABLES,
considering an EXPONENTIAL_DECLINE. we consider a scenario where we have
an EXPLORATORY_PROJECT with HIGH_LEVES of uncertainties regarding
POSSIBLE_FUTURE_PRODUCTION. based on EXPLORATORY_INFORMATION about the
field the company will decide if it will develop the reservoir or not.
these UNCERTAIN_VARIABLES are modeled by STOCHASTIC_PROCESSES causing
impact on the PRODUCTION of an OIL_FIELD and in its ECONOMIC_RETURNS as a
result. the model's MAIN_IDEA is the definition of a decision_making rule
including the VALUATION of the FLEXIBILITY from the possibility of
delaying an INVESTMENT in an OIL_FIELD due to better
GEOLOGICAL_INFORMATION. we used a CONTINUOUS_TIME REAL_OPTION_MODEL to
estimate the OPTION_VALUE and INVESTMENT_TRIGGER_POINT and compared the
results to estimates from EVALUATION using traditonal discounted
CASH_FLOW ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS_METHODOLOGY. the EVALUATION_MODEL is applied
to a set of PRODUCTION_CURVES based on REAL_PRODUCTION_DATA from a
producing reservoir located in the BRAZILIAN_NORTHEASTERN_COAST.
PRELIMINARY_RESULTS show that the INVESTMENT _ rule is different from
that of TRADITIONAL_NPV, that is, insvest as long as NPV > 0. the
methodology can be used as an ADDITIONAL_ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS
decision_making tool to help MANAGERS decide in an
UNCERTAIN_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT. this model does not eliminate the

Title: OPTIMAL_TIMING for INVESTMENT_DECISIONS
Abstract:
```
the net PRESENT_VALUE (nvp) is an IMPORTANT_CONCEPT in
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. as ingersoll and ross have pointed out, the
FUTURE_FLUCTUATION of INTEREST_RATES is expected to have
SIGNIFICANT_EFFECTS on the PRESENT_VALUE (PV) of the project concerned.
if INTEREST_RATES are expected to fall off in the next year, deferring an
INVESTMENT for yet another year is likely to be more gainful even if its
CURRENT_NPV is positive. the effects of deferment can be valued from its
CORRESPONDING_AMERICAN_OPTION_VALUE. berk proposed a SIMPLE_CRITERION for
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS which incorporate this AMERICAN_OPTION_VALUE of
INVESTMENT. the simplicity of this model is obtained from the
APPROPRIATE_USAGE of a CALLABLE_BOND. it is admirable that this model
does not postulate any assumptions on the behavior of INTEREST_RATES. but
this construction of the model has the pros and cons. it is easy to
implement this model in business because the only adjustment required in
this model is to replace the INTEREST_RATE in NPV with the CALLABLE_RATE.
on the other hand, the properties of this criterion have not been
clarified. in this paper we analyze berk's model under the assumption
that INTEREST_RATES follow the GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION (gbm). by
assuming the movement of INTEREST_RATES, we can derive an
ANALYTICAL_SOLUTION for the OPTIMAL_TIMING for the INVESTMENTS in terms
of the parameters of the gbm. this enables us to perform
COMPARATIVE_STATICS and SIMULATION. these RESULTS_EXTRACT some properties
of berk's model and help the DECISION_MAKERS in implementing berk's
model.

Title: multidimensional RISK based REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION for low CARBON

Abstract:
```
ENERGY_PRICE_FLUCTUATIONS_POSE a SIGNIFICANT_RISK and UNCERTAINTY to
FINANCIAL_INVESTMENTS for NEW_DEVELOPMENTS in CONVENTIONAL_POWER and
FRESHWATER_COGENERATION_FACILITIES. this STUDY_ATTEMPTS to address the
problem of making ROBUST_VALUATION for low_carbon ENERGY project
INVESTMENTS subject to multi_dimensional PRICE_RISK, particularly looking
at some KEY_RESEARCH_QUESTIONS: (a) how does the CORRELATION_STRUCTURE,
or independence, between the PRICE_RISKS affect the PROJECT_VALUE; and
(b) does adding FLEXIBILITY in INVESTMENT_ENHANCE or worsen the
PROJECT_VALUATION, given (a). this study identified three PRICE_FACTORS
with SIGNIFICANT_FLUCTUATIONS that impact CONVENTIONAL_POWER_GENERATION,
namely: WHOLESALE_ELECTRICITY_SPOT_PRICE, NATURAL_GAS_SPOT_PRICE, and
CO2_MARKET_PRICE. the PRICE_FACTORS were used to construct a
MULTIDIMENSIONAL_RISK_MODEL and evaluate INVESTMENT_DECISIONS for
COGENERATION_PROJECT_EXPANSION in the FUTURE based on a low_carbon
ENERGY_MIX. to this end, five COGENERATION_CONFIGURATIONS using
combined_cycle gas turbine (ccgt) integrated with SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS
(PV) and CARBON_CAPTURE_AND_STORAGE (ccs) technologies were assessed. a
combined PRICE_RISK was initially estimated by transforming the given
PRICE_FACTORS representing MAXIMUM_COVARIANCE using
PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT_ANALYSIS (pca). the trend and volatilities in the
MAJOR_PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT_SCORES (the combined PRICE_RISK_INDICATOR) were
modelled using the GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION_STOCHASTIC_PROCESS, whose
parameters were determined and then used to perform time_series
SIMULATION and generate MULTIPLE_REALISATIONS of the PRINCIPAL_COMPONENT.
a BACK_TRANSFORMATION was then applied to obtain the simulated values
representing FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES in the PRICE_FACTORS. the effect of
PRICE_RISK and uncertainties were subsequently evaluated using a
recombining BINOMIAL_LATTICE_MODEL for REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA). there
were FINANCIAL_GAINS when PV was mixed with conventional natural
gas_fired TECHNOLOGY. INVESTMENT in COGENERATION_CONFIGURATIONS with (a)
25% PV share provided a 53% gain in the extended net PRESENT_VALUE
(ENPV); and (b) 50% PV share provided a 124% ENPV gain when compared to
the BASELINE_COGENERATION_SYSTEM with no PV_SHARES. the analyses
demonstrate that PV_TECHNOLOGY is a better hedging option than ccs
against FUTURE_MARKET_UNCERTAINTY and PRICE_VOLATILITY.  2023 by the

were introduced to alleviate the FINANCIAL_PRESSURE, but their
achievements are unable to meet the expected PERFORMANCE_LEVEL.
therefore, a QUESTION_ARAISES: can yieldcos promote the development of

explore the impacts of DECISIVE_FACTORS on the DEFER_OPTION_VALUE,
INVESTMENT_THRESHOLD and expected EXECUTION_TIME. the JOINT_IMPACTS of
the DIVIDEND_RATIO and other factors are also investigated. we conclude
that yieldcos are suitable for SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS, while a
HIGH_DIVIDEND_RATIO will make INVESTORS_POSTPONE their INVESTMENTS. in
addition, by using the TECHNOLOGICAL_LEVEL to represent the DRIFT_TERM of
INVESTMENT, we further discuss how decision_makers should react to the
POTENTIAL_TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION. moreover, we also discuss the impacts
of potential declines in feed_in tariffs on INVESTORS_BEHAVIOUR. we

In the field of renewable energy investments, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, the complexities arising from uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements necessitate a refined and adaptable approach to investment decision-making. Real Options Analysis (ROA) offers a strategic and versatile framework in this context. For instance, in China, the integration of the American Option Method with a learning curve method demonstrated ROA's superiority over traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in navigating uncertainties in renewable energy policy, thus underscoring the importance of balancing the interests of the government and investors [149]. In Italy, the volatile PV market, heavily influenced by fluctuating government incentives, highlighted the impact of uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs on delaying optimal investment decisions, as evaluated through real options methods [130].

In the UK, the use of real options theory has enhanced the attractiveness of domestic PV systems by providing a strategy to defer investment in response to rapid technological changes [133]. A study comparing investments in solar and wind energy using ROA showed that learning rates significantly influence investment decisions, suggesting that under certain scenarios, focusing on one technology might be more beneficial than diversification [33]. Moreover, assessing PV power investments in existing buildings, considering uncertainties in tariffs, technology costs, and regulatory policies, emphasized the value of integrating ROA with stochastic simulation. This approach indicated that while standard appraisal methods might initially overlook rooftop PV projects, option valuation methods advocate for keeping these investment opportunities open for future reassessment [97].

The significance of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) in investment decisions in distributed solar generation is substantial. Optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments is critical and can be effectively modeled as real options, accounting for uncertainties in REC prices, as shown in the study by Zeng [154]. The complexity of planning off-grid microgrids in developing countries, amidst uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, highlights the need for innovative stochastic dynamic methods in investment planning, favoring multi-year optimization strategies over traditional single-year methods [45].

Advanced numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method have been developed to address the uncertainty in solar power project investments. This method integrates option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, emphasizing the importance of determining the optimal timing for project initiation [75]. The need for a decision-making framework that considers the optimal timing of investment under demand uncertainties in residential photovoltaic investments is also highlighted, using the Real Option Method to explore various investment strategies for long-term benefits [160].

Investing in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory underscores the necessity for accurate financial valuation models, particularly when contemplating future installations of PV technologies [102]. Determining the optimal timing for installing building-integrated PV systems becomes critical under price uncertainties, adding a layer of managerial flexibility to investment decisions [89]. The development of an innovation diffusion model for renewable energy deployment, integrating agent-based modeling with real options, demonstrates the influence of individual risk preferences and social networks on renewable energy investment decisions, offering valuable insights for policy recommendations to promote the PV market [26]. Assessing the demand response value in PV systems based on real options theory further emphasizes the increasing relevance of environmental factors in investment decisions [111]. Finally, evaluating defer and relocation options in PV generation investments through stochastic simulation-based methods underlines the need for risk management and strategic flexibility in electricity markets, advocating for appropriate methodologies to assess the economic value of PV power plants under uncertainties [3].

These records collectively underscore the critical importance of considering uncertainties and managerial flexibility in making informed and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector, with a special focus on solar PV power generation.

Title: a REAL_OPTIONS based DECISION_MAKING model analysis for CLIMATE_CHANGE
MITIGATION_STRATEGIES on BUILDINGS
Abstract:
```
FLEXIBLE_OPTIONS are expected to be adopted in CLIMATE_CHANGE
MITIGATION_STRATEGIES due to the HIGH_UNCERTAINTY of CLIMATE_CHANGE.
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) matches the feature of filling FLEXIBILITY
under CLIMATE_CHANGE but is seldom leveraged in the decision_making of
STRATEGY_INVESTMENT at the building scale. this study proposes a
roa_based decision_making framework to bridge this RESEARCH_GAP. first,
the FUTURE_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION is simulated, and the expected yearly
FUTURE_ENERGY_LOSS caused by CLIMATE_CHANGE is calculated. then,
individual and SEQUENTIAL_INVESTMENT_ANALYSES are made based on ROA and
three strategies (i.e., shading, PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS, and shading +
PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS). finally, a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS for
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME, INVESTMENT_SEQUENCE, etc., is performed, and
REGRESSION_ANALYSIS is used to prove and extend the
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS_RESULTS. the results show that CLIMATE_CHANGE
UNCERTAINTY does not alter the optimal individual and
SEQUENTIAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES. however, increasing the
DISCOUNT_RATE_ADVANCES the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME and shows an
EXPONENTIAL_RELATIONSHIP with the premium. the enhancement of forcing has
a MARGINAL_EFFECT on PROJECT_RETURN and it advances the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_YEAR for INDIVIDUAL_INVESTMENT. additionally, the
forcing positively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option
under shared socioeconomic pathways ssp1_2.6 and ssp2_4.5 but it
negatively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option under
ssp3_7.0 and ssp5_8.5. the UNIT_DRY_BULB_TEMPERATURE under certain
forcing yields a range of benefits from 0.47  106 to 0.90  106 usd when
deferring the option. this proposed decision_making FRAMEWORK_GUIDES the
development of MITIGATION_STRATEGIES and provides more
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY for investors.  2023 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: valuing PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS by compound REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
MEETING_ELECTRICITY_DEMAND with RENEWABLE_GENERATION requires spending
trillions of dollars in INVESTMENTS exposed to FINANCIAL_RISK.
RENEWABLE_PROJECTS have MULTIPLE_STRATEGIC_REAL_OPTIONS to
MANAGE_INVESTMENT_RISK, but they are usually priced separately in
isolation. this paper proposes a framework for valuing
MULTISTAGE_DECISIONS in a grid_scale PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_PLANT under
UNCERTAINTY. the project is modelled as a COMPOUND_PORTFOLIO of
AMERICAN_SEQUENTIAL and mutually EXCLUSIVE_OPTIONS to defer, expand and
relocate. the COMPOUND_OPTIONS are jointly priced by a hierarchically
nested least_squares MONTE_CARLO ALGORITHM. the
FRAMEWORK_INCORPORATES_UNCERTAINTIES related to decreasing COSTS in
SOLAR_TECHNOLOGY and the EMERGENCE of more PROFITABLE_RENEWABLE_TARIFFS
elsewhere. the results show that the value of the
COMPOUND_OPTION_PORTFOLIO significantly exceeds the value of the single
DEFERRAL_OPTION commonly considered in practice. ignoring expansion and
RELOCATION_FLEXIBILITIES may lead to underinvestment by mispricing the
value of PV_PROJECTS. incorporating these OPTIONS_ENCOURAGES
EARLY_COMMITMENT of the PV_INVESTMENT. moreover, summation of
INDIVIDUAL_OPTION_PRICES may not be a GOOD_APPROXIMATION of the
TRUE_PORTFOLIO_VALUE, as interactions among options exist. these findings
may improve ALLOCATION_EFFICIENCY of RENEWABLE_INVESTMENTS,

Abstract:
```
WIND and SOLAR_POWER_DEPRESS_MARKET_PRICES at times when they produce the
most. this has been termed the CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT, and its magnitude
has been established within the ECONOMIC_LITERATURE on current and
FUTURE_MARKETS. although it has a SUBSTANTIAL_IMPACT on the revenue of
VRE_TECHNOLOGIES, the CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT is neglected in the CAPITAL
budgeting literature, including portfolio_ and REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY. in
this paper, we present an ANALYTICAL_FRAMEWORK that explicitly MODELS the
correlation between VRE_PRODUCTION and ELECTRICITY_PRICE, based on the
PRODUCTION_COSTS of surrounding GENERATION_CAPACITY. we derive
closed_form expressions for the expected short_term and long_term
revenue, the variance of the revenue and the timing of INVESTMENTS. the
effect of including these SYSTEM_CHARACTERISTICS is illustrated with
NUMERICAL_EXAMPLES, where we find the CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT to decrease
projected profit relative to INVESTMENT_COST from 33% to between 13% and
40%, depending on the assumption for the
FUTURE_VRE_CAPACITY_EXPANSION_RATE. using a REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK, the
INVESTMENT_THRESHOLD_INCREASES by between 13% and 67%, due to the
inclusion of cannibalization.  2023

Title: estimating INCENTIVE_CONTRACTS for SOLAR_PV based MICROGRID_PRODUCTION
considering COST benefit UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
the SOLAR pv_based MICROGRID, as a NEW_MODE of PRODUCTION and consumption
of CLEAN_ENERGY, backs up the variability of RENEWABLES and has
IMPORTANT_IMPLICATIONS for mitigating GLOBAL_CLIMATE change. however, its
further development is limited because of the HIGH_COST and UNCERTAINTY,
which discourages its OPERATORS_INVESTMENT_WILLINGNESS. to guide
CAPITAL_INVESTMENT in MICROGRIDS, we construct a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL to
investigate the FLEXIBLE_INVESTMENT of operators and the
OPTIMAL_INCENTIVE_CONTRACT under UNCERTAINTY. the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD can
more accurately measure the value of REAL_ASSETS in an
UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT, and help decision_makers to
ASSESS_INVESTMENT_COSTS and benefits. moreover, a DEMONSTRATION_PROJECT
in hefei, CHINA is provided as a CASE_STUDY to analyze the impact of the
peak_valley price rates and COST_CHANGES on the INCENTIVE_CONTRACT. the
results demonstrate that subsidies are still necessary to accelerate the
development of SOLAR pv_based MICROGRIDS. however, subsidies in hefei can
be stopped until the INVESTMENT_COST_DROPS to 6101.25 rmb/kw. alleviating
the COST_PRESSURE on operators can stimulate them to adopt the SOLAR
pv_based MICROGRID, but RAPID_COST_REDUCTIONS and fluctuations could
hinder its development. we further uncover that raising the peak_valley
price rate can help to reduce the GOVERNMENT's FINANCIAL_BURDEN caused by
subsidies.  2022, hard publishing company. all rights reserved.

Title: INVESTMENT_DECISION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS based on stochastic
modelling of SOLAR_IRRADIATION and SHORTFALL_PENALTIES_FORESEEN in
CENTRALIZED_GENERATION auctions contracts
Abstract:
```
in the last decade, PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) ENERGY has grown within the
BRAZILIAN_ELECTRICITY_MATRIX and still presents a promising decarbonized
alternative. thus, the assessment of the viability of INVESTMENT in
PV_PROJECTS in a DYNAMIC_MARKET and REGULATION_FRAMEWORK is necessary.
the STANDARD_APPROACHES to INVESTMENT_DECISION taking: net PRESENT_VALUE
(NPV) of forecasted discounted cash flows (dcf) consider both the return
and RISK of the project. nonetheless, these approaches do not consider
several uncertainties that may CONSTITUTE_RISK_FACTORS, such as the
variability of SOLAR_IRRADIATION and the PENALTY_RULES imposed by the
regulator. in this paper, MONTHLY_DAILY_MEASUREMENTS of the
SOLAR_RESOURCE were collected over five YEARS in the BRAZILIAN_STATE of
rio de janeiro. using this database, the STATISTICAL_DISTRIBUTION that
best fits the variability of irradiance is determined. a centralized
PV_SOLAR_ENERGY_PROJECT is simulated under the TYPICAL_CHARACTERISTICS of
auctions held since 2014 by the brazilian NATIONAL_AGENCY of
ELECTRIC_ENERGY (aneel). MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is applied on the
IRRADIATION_DATA and the RISK of the FINANCIAL_RETURN falling below a
specified value is calculated, using a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to estimate
the effect of ENERGY_OUTPUT_SHORTFALL. to the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work contemplating FINANCIAL_RISK_QUANTIFICATION of
centralized_generation auctions contracts using such an approach, which
MIXES_MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION, expected shortfall and REAL_OPTIONS. it
demonstrates how important it can be to CAPITAL_INVESTORS to correctly
value the COMPOUND_EFFECT of IRRADIATION_VARIABILITY coupled with
REGULATORY_RULES, and the FINANCIAL_RISK_EFFECT these issues might have
on the PROJECT_VALUE of centralized_generation projects. it can be
clearly seen that the CORRESPONDING_NPV of the project is significantly
reduced from almost 8 million r$ to less than 2 million r$, with capping
RULES_PENALTIES, and to less than 0.6 million r$ in the case of
OUTPUT_SHORTFALL. but more important is the RISK arising from
non_compliance, or shortfall, with the guaranty contracted in the
auction. this penalty can cause up to 30% RISK of a NEGATIVE_NPV, or
almost 0.36 million r$ expected shortfall or cvar, compared to no RISK or
very SMALL_LOSS_RISK when without the effect of CONTRACT_PENALTIES.

In the dynamic world of renewable energy investments, with a specific focus on solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation, the challenges posed by uncertainties in costs, prices, and technological advancements call for a sophisticated approach to investment decision-making. Real Options Analysis (ROA) emerges as a critical tool in this scenario, offering the necessary flexibility to navigate these uncertainties. This approach is highlighted in China, where integrating the American Option Method with a learning curve approach proved ROA's effectiveness over traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis in managing uncertainties in renewable energy policies, emphasizing the need for a balance between government and investor interests [149]. In Italy, the fluidity of the PV market, influenced by changing government incentives, showcased how uncertainties in energy prices and PV module costs could significantly delay optimal investment decisions, as evaluated through real options methods [130].

In the UK, the application of real options theory has increased the appeal of domestic PV systems by providing a strategic means to defer investment in response to rapid technological advancements [133]. A comparative study of investments in solar and wind energy using ROA indicated that learning rates are a critical factor influencing investment decisions, suggesting that under certain conditions, a focused investment in a single technology might be more advantageous than diversification [33]. Further, the assessment of PV power investments in existing buildings, taking into account uncertainties in tariffs, technology costs, and regulatory policies, highlighted the importance of combining ROA with stochastic simulation. This method suggests that while standard appraisal methods might initially neglect rooftop PV projects, option valuation methods recommend keeping these investment opportunities open for future reassessment [97].

The significance of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) and the Alternative Compliance Payment (ACP) in investment decisions in distributed solar generation is substantial. The study by Zeng demonstrated that optimal timing for potential buyback contracts in solar panel investments is vital, and these scenarios can be effectively modeled as real options, factoring in uncertainties in REC prices [154]. The complexity of planning off-grid microgrids in developing countries, amid uncertainties in load growth and asset degradation, underlines the importance of advanced stochastic dynamic methods in investment planning, preferring multi-year optimization strategies over traditional single-year methods [45].

Advanced numerical methods like the Lobatto3C Milstein method have been developed to tackle uncertainty in solar power project investments. This method incorporates option valuation for solar energy investment under uncertainty, stressing the importance of identifying the optimal timing for project initiation [75]. The need for a decision-making framework that accommodates the optimal timing of investment under demand uncertainties in residential photovoltaic investments is also emphasized, using the Real Option Method to explore various investment strategies for long-term gains [160].

Investing in 'solar-ready' buildings using real options theory emphasizes the necessity for accurate financial valuation models, especially when considering future installations of PV technologies [102]. Determining the optimal timing for installing building-integrated PV systems becomes critical under price uncertainties, adding an element of managerial flexibility to investment decisions [89]. The development of an innovation diffusion model for renewable energy deployment, integrating agent-based modeling with real options, illustrates the impact of individual risk preferences and social networks on renewable energy investment decisions, providing valuable insights for policy recommendations to advance the PV market [26]. Evaluating the demand response value in PV systems based on real options theory further underscores the growing importance of environmental considerations in investment decisions [111]. Finally, assessing defer and relocation options in PV generation investments through stochastic simulation-based methods highlights the significance of risk management and strategic flexibility in electricity markets, advocating for appropriate methodologies to evaluate the economic value of PV power plants under uncertainties [3].

These records collectively underscore the critical importance of considering uncertainties and managerial flexibility in making informed and dynamic investment decisions in the renewable energy sector, with a special emphasis on solar PV power generation.

Title: deriving FUTURE_BUILDING_STOCKS from home owners' REAL_OPTION to
DEFER_INVESTMENTS
Abstract:
```
PRIVATE_HOME_OWNERS are free to invest in ENERGY EFFICIENT_REFURBISHMENTS
of their building at any time. besides, they can
INSTALL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS, HEAT_PUMPS and other EQUIPMENT at will.
although the consequences for DISTRIBUTION_GRIDS can be significant, most
studies about the FUTURE supply task still utilize fixed ANNUAL_RATES of
refurbishment and scenarios for the installation of distributed
ENERGY_RESOURCES (der). while highly ECONOMICAL_INVESTMENTS are usually
undertaken, a lot of UNCERTAINTY remains for PRIVATE_INVESTORS. in this
study, the effect of SUCH_UNCERTAINTIES is modelled in terms of a highly
FLEXIBLE_REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION that focuses on the option to defer an
INVESTMENT. it is therefore assumed that the expected value of most
INVESTMENTS is high while a SIGNIFICANT_AMOUNT of RISK has to be dealt
with. HISTORIC_DATA of refurbishment and MARKET_SITUATION is used to

Title: a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to evaluating the PROFITABILITY of PHOTOVOLTAIC
based MINI_GRIDS in BANGLADESH
Abstract:
```
CONVENTIONAL_NPV_ANALYSIS often reveals that the price of ELECTRICITY
produced by SOLAR_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGY is significantly higher than that
produced by FOSSIL_FUEL using POWER_PLANTS. in the context of BANGLADESH,
this difference becomes more marked because the GOVERNMENT of
BANGLADESH_SUBSIDIZES the GRID_ELECTRICITY, offering it to consumers at a
COST below the COST of PRODUCTION. as a result, any COMMERCIAL_VENTURE to
supply SOLAR powered ENERGY must find its markets only in off GRID_AREAS
where the GOVERNMENT_TRANSMISSION_SYSTEM has not reached. however,
FINANCE theory tells us that an INVESTMENT must be evaluated not only the
basis of its COSTS and returns, but also on the basis of its RISK. the
RISK of a given PV based POWER_PLANT_PROJECT to supply a town or village
can be evaluated using the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD. this reveals that the
options inherent in the installment and operations of a PV_GRID lower its
COST to make it more competitive with ELECTRICITY.  2012 icdret.

Title: toward a framework for quantifying RETURN_ON_INVESTMENT (ROI) of MODELING
and SIMULATION (m&s) STANDARDIZATION
Abstract:
```
it is well known that m&S_STANDARDS, especially
INFRASTRUCTURE_M&S_STANDARDS, provide COST_SAVINGS (or COST_AVOIDANCE)
through INTEROPERABILITY and model and SOFTWARE_REUSE. furthermore, they
represent "seals of approval" to the m&S_COMMUNITY and thus
FACILITATE_RISK_MITIGATION when adopting NEW_TECHNOLOGIES and paradigms.
while m&S_STANDARDIZATION is imperative, a framework for quantifying
return_on_investment (ROI) of m&S_STANDARDIZATION is not currently
available. as realized by LORD_WILLIAM_THOMSON_KELVIN (1824_1907), who
invented the KELVIN_SCALE of temperature, "when you can measure what you
are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about
it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in
numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and UNSATISFACTORY_KIND" this
paper is an attempt to devise a framework for quantifying ROI of
m&S_STANDARDIZATION. the approach takes into consideration of both time
and UNCERTAINTY. TIME_CONSIDERATION is based on the concept of net
PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) espoused in the OMB_CIRCULAR no. a_94 revised, 29
october 1992. NPV, the discounted monetized value of NET_BENEFITS,
provides a level playing field for time distributed COSTS and benefits by
reducing a stream of COSTS and benefits to a single number. in the
absence of UNCERTAINTY, ROI can be formulated as the ratio of the NPV to
the PRESENT_VALUE (PV) of COSTS. UNCERTAINTY_TREATMENT is based on
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (also called REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION). this
VALUATION_APPROACH allows FLEXIBILITY in execution and has gained
foothold in the decision_making process. combining time and
UNCERTAINTY_CONSIDERATIONS, ROI can be defined as the ratio of the
expanded NPV (ENPV) to the PV of COSTS that reduces to the ratio of the
NPV to PV of COSTS when there is no UNCERTAINTY. this
QUANTIFICATION_FRAMEWORK is general and amendable to changes.
