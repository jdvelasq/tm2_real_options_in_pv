Title: OPTIMAL_SUBSIDY_ESTIMATION_METHOD using SYSTEM_DYNAMICS and the
REAL_OPTION_MODEL: PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY_CASE
Abstract:
```
in this paper, we propose a method of optimizing FINANCIAL_SUBSIDIES and
PUBLIC_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENTS for
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, rather than optimizing FINANCIAL_SUBSIDY
alone. by combining SYSTEM_DYNAMICS with REAL_OPTION_MODELS, we capture
DYNAMIC_COMPLEX_INTERACTIONS among investors, consumers, and
policymakers, as well as FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES of KEY_ENERGY, economic,
and ENVIRONMENTAL_FACTORS. our method thereby makes SUBSIDY_OPTIMIZATION
more accurate and flexible. to evaluate our model, we apply it to the
KOREAN_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SUBSIDY and determine that the GOVERNMENT can achieve
the PHOTOVOLTAIC_DIFFUSION_TARGET, even if it reduces the TOTAL_SUBSIDY
by $us 359.5. million. the OPTIMAL_APPROACH is to increase
RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT FUNDING by $us 310.4. million while reducing the
FINANCIAL_SUBSIDY by $us 669.9. million. our method helps
POLICYMAKERS_OPTIMIZE their SUBSIDY_ALLOCATION and therefore
REDUCES_SUBSIDY_INEFFICIENCIES.  2015 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Abstract:
```
STRATEGIC_VALUATION of efficient and well_timed NETWORK_INVESTMENTS under
UNCERTAIN_ELECTRICITY_MARKET_ENVIRONMENT has become increasingly

work, a REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION (ROV) framework is proposed to determine
the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY for executing multiple interacting options within a

in the presence of FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES. to demonstrate the
characteristics of the proposed framework, we determine the
OPTIMAL_STRATEGY to economically justify the INVESTMENT in residential
pv_battery systems for ADDITIONAL_GRID supply during PEAK_DEMAND_PERIODS.
the options to defer, and then expand, are considered as multi_stage

In the energy markets, particularly with regard to photovoltaic (PV) technology and smart grids, the relationship between investment evaluation, timing, and value is complex and multi-faceted. For instance, the integration of PV technology into smart grids has been shown to increase investment values, as evidenced by studies in the Italian electricity market [78]. This integration allows for greater managerial flexibility, with the opportunity to sell energy via smart grids encouraging investments in larger PV plants, thereby positively influencing the optimal size and timing of investments [78][9].

Similarly, strategic investment evaluation models, such as the Real Option Model, play a crucial role in this sector. They help in optimizing financial subsidies and public research and development investments for renewable energy technologies [120]. By considering dynamic interactions and future uncertainties, these models enhance the accuracy and flexibility of subsidy optimization, thereby reducing inefficiencies [120].

Moreover, the timing of investments in residential PV systems is significantly affected by cost uncertainty and the option to defer investment. For instance, the optimal investment time for residential PV systems changes in response to volatility and benefits, illustrating that smaller PV systems might require a longer waiting period for substantial diffusion compared to larger systems [81].

Furthermore, the valuation of investments in residential PV battery systems in uncertain electricity market environments has become increasingly challenging. The use of Real Options Valuation (ROV) to determine the optimal strategy for executing multiple interacting options within a distribution network investment can mitigate financial risks and increase investment value [57].

In summary, the relationship among these keywords is centered around the strategic evaluation of investments in the energy sector, particularly in PV technology and smart grids. It involves considering the timing, size, and flexibility of investments, alongside the uncertainties and dynamic interactions in the market [78][9][120][81][57].

Title: valuing INVESTMENTS in domestic PV BATTERY_SYSTEMS under UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES are expected to play a MAJOR_ROLE in
mitigating CLIMATE_CHANGE and RESOURCE_DEPLETION effects as well as in
contributing to DOMESTIC_ENERGY_SECURITY. due to the INTERMITTENT_NATURE
of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV), there are often SIGNIFICANT_GAPS between
ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and ENERGY supply by PV_PLANTS. this makes
STORAGE_SYSTEMS a POTENTIAL_OPTION to MAXIMIZE_SAVINGS and
ACCRUE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY by increasing the share of self_consumed
ENERGY while guaranteeing ADEQUATE_POWER_LEVELS in DISTRIBUTION_GRIDS.
this paper provides a THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK to MODEL_HOUSEHOLDS_DECISION
to invest in DOMESTIC_PV_PLANTS coupled with BATTERY_STORAGE. to capture
the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY relative to the decision to install
both a PV_PLANT and a battery, i.e., a domestic pv_battery system (pvb),
we implement a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH and propose an OPTIMIZATION_MODEL,
which we calibrate and test according to data from the
ITALIAN_ENERGY_MARKET. our findings show that the option of storing
ENERGY via BATTERIES_INCREASES de facto INVESTMENT_VALUE: the adoption of
a PVB_INCREASES_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, as HOUSEHOLDS can optimally
exercise the option to decide their consumption and
STORAGE_PATTERNS_CONTINGENT on FAVORABLE_MARKET_CONDITIONS. the
opportunity to STORE_ENERGY via BATTERIES_ENCOURAGES_HOUSEHOLDS to invest
in larger plants compared to those not paired with BATTERIES. there is

Title: do SMART_GRID_INNOVATIONS affect REAL_ESTATE_MARKET_VALUES?
Abstract:
```
to DATE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_SYSTEMS have been widely installed on homes
in europe and all over the world. in europe and in ITALY INVESTMENTS in
DOMESTIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS (PV) were boosted by generous feed_in
tariffs that made these INVESTMENTS extremely attractive for
SMALL_PRIVATE_INVESTORS, such as homeowners. it is commonly agreed that
the greater the building ENERGY_EFFICIENCY, the greater the
PROPERTY_MARKET_VALUE. it is of PARAMOUNT_IMPORTANCE to determine the
value that PV_SYSTEMS may add to HOME_SALE_TRANSACTIONS. the aim of the
paper is to investigate whether SMART_GRIDS (sgs) INNOVATION can increase
MARKET_VALUES due to higher PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_FLEXIBILITY. sgs
give de facto producers and consumers, the opportunity to be active in
the ENERGY_MARKET and strategically decide their optimal
PRODUCTION/consumption pattern. in this paper, we provide a model based
on the REAL_OPTION_THEORY to determine the value of this FLEXIBILITY and
the related MARKET_VALUE_INCREASE. we model the HOMEOWNER_DECISION to
invest in a SOLAR_HOME with a PV_PLANT and connect to an sg by comparison
to the decision to invest in a SOLAR_HOME not connected to an sg. we
determine the PROPERTY_POTENTIAL_MARKET_VALUE_INCREASE due to the
opportunity to perform ACTIVE_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT given by SMART_GRIDS and
we compare this VALUE_INCREASE to the PV_PLANT_VALUE per se. to capture
the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY we implement a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH.
results of simulations, performed according to ZONAL_PRICES' trend and
VOLATILITY in the north and south of ITALY, show that in the north and in
the south, being connected to an SG_INCREASES by about 5_10% the

growing RENEWABLE_PENETRATION in DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS. however, it is
challenging to determine efficient and well_timed INVESTMENT in the

within this context, we develop a methodology that explicitly (i)
INCORPORATES_ESS_SCHEDULES within MONTE_CARLO_POWER_FLOW_SIMULATIONS, and
(ii) determine the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY using
REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION (ROV). specifically, we develop a mixed
INTEGER_QUADRATIC programming to determine the OPTIMAL_SIZE and schedules
of a grid_scale ess in an AUSTRALIAN_DISTRIBUTION_NETWORK. the benefits
from BATTERY_OPERATIONS to the network are quantitatively incorporated in
the ROV to capture the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, and hence the

In the context of energy markets, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) technology and smart grids has a significant impact on investment evaluation, timing, and value. The incorporation of PV systems into smart grids has been demonstrated to elevate investment values, especially in the Italian electricity market [78]. This integration provides a higher degree of managerial flexibility, enabling energy producers and consumers to actively participate in the market. As a result, there is an encouragement for investments in larger PV plants, which positively affects the optimal size and timing of these investments [78][9].

Strategic investment evaluation models, notably the Real Option Model, are vital in this domain. They aid in refining financial subsidies and investments in public research and development for renewable energy technologies [120]. By accounting for dynamic interactions and future uncertainties, these models enhance the precision and adaptability of subsidy optimization, leading to reduced inefficiencies [120].

The timing of investments in residential PV systems is intricately linked to cost uncertainty and the option to defer investment. The optimal investment time for these systems varies with volatility in the market and changing benefits, suggesting that smaller PV systems may have longer waiting periods for widespread diffusion compared to larger systems [81]. Moreover, the value of investments in domestic PV battery systems under uncertainty has been emphasized. The potential of storage systems to maximize savings and accrue managerial flexibility, especially in managing the intermittent nature of solar PV, has been highlighted [28]. This managerial flexibility, enhanced by the option to optimally determine consumption and storage patterns based on favorable market conditions, increases the de facto investment value and encourages investment in larger plants [28].

Additionally, the role of smart grids in increasing the market value of real estate through enhanced energy production and consumption flexibility has been identified [1]. Smart grids enable active energy management, thus increasing the market value of properties equipped with PV systems [1]. The value of flexibility offered by smart grids has also been modeled through the Real Option Theory, underscoring the importance of strategic decision-making in investments [1].

Furthermore, the design flexibility in uncertain distributed generation from photovoltaics has been explored, demonstrating that treating future patterns of distributed energy resources as deterministic can lead to overlooked design solutions [95]. This flexibility is crucial for planning in electric distribution systems amidst uncertainty [95].

In summary, the interplay among these keywords revolves around the strategic assessment of investments in the energy sector, focusing on PV technology and smart grids. It involves evaluating the timing, size, and flexibility of investments in the face of market uncertainties and dynamic interactions [78][9][120][81][28][1][95].

Title: VALUATION of compound REAL_OPTIONS for co INVESTMENT in

the process of evaluating INVESTMENTS by ELECTRICITY_UTILITIES to

REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION (ROV) to solve the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PROBLEM for
subsidizing RESIDENTIAL_BATTERY_INSTALLATIONS, considering
COMPOUND_OPTIONS including the option to delay the INVESTMENT and its
SUBSEQUENT_OPTION (expand). we INCORPORATE_RANDOM_VARIATIONS in
PV_GENERATION and LOAD_BEHAVIOUR, making use of MONTE_CARLO (mc)
POWER_FLOW_ANALYSIS that INCORPORATES_BATTERY_SCHEDULING_PROFILES.
specifically, the ROV_FRAMEWORK_SOLVES_STOCHASTIC_POWER_FLOW_ANALYSIS
with BATTERY_SCHEDULING in a forward_looking MC_MODEL, and determines the
OPTIMAL_PLAN for executing the options that maximize the INVESTMENT_VALUE
using BACKWARD_INDUCTION over all MC_PATHS. however, this approach to mc
becomes computationally prohibitive when BATTERY_OPERATIONAL_PROFILES are
generated by optimization_based home ENERGY_MANAGEMENT. to reduce the
COMPUTATIONAL_BURDEN, we use POLICY_FUNCTION_APPROXIMATION to provide
FAST_BATTERY_OPERATIONAL_PROFILES, drawing on MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS
that reduce MC_COMPUTATION_TIME by 95%. compared to
STANDARD_FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS, the proposed model allows ROV to capture all
uncertainties while allowing utilities to make CONTINGENT_DECISIONS to
maximize the benefits from subsidizing RESIDENTIAL_BATTERY_STORAGE.  2022

In energy markets, particularly regarding photovoltaic (PV) technology and smart grids, the relationships between investment evaluation, timing, and value are intricate and dynamic. The integration of PV systems with smart grids notably enhances investment values, a trend observed in the Italian electricity market [78]. This integration grants greater managerial flexibility, empowering energy producers and consumers to participate actively in the market. Consequently, this fosters investments in larger PV plants, which in turn influences the optimal investment size and timing [78][9].

Strategic investment evaluation models, such as the Real Option Model (ROM), are pivotal in this field. They refine the assessment of financial subsidies and public research investments in renewable energy technologies, taking into account dynamic market interactions and future uncertainties. This approach improves the accuracy and flexibility of subsidy optimization, thereby reducing inefficiencies [120].

The timing of investments in residential PV systems is closely linked to market volatility and the option to delay investment. For smaller PV systems, a longer waiting period might be necessary before achieving significant market diffusion, compared to larger systems [81]. The value of investments in domestic PV battery systems under uncertainty is accentuated, emphasizing the potential of storage systems to maximize savings and managerial flexibility [28]. This flexibility, enhanced by smart grids, enables optimized energy consumption and storage patterns, increasing investment values [28][1].

Furthermore, the role of smart grids in increasing real estate market values through enhanced energy production and consumption flexibility is recognized [1]. Smart grids provide active energy management opportunities, thus boosting the market value of properties with PV systems. This flexibility value is also captured using the Real Option Theory, highlighting strategic investment decision-making importance [1].

In addition, the flexibility in design for uncertain distributed generation from PVs is explored. Treating future patterns of distributed energy resources as deterministic overlooks potential design solutions, emphasizing the need for flexibility in planning electric distribution systems amidst uncertainty [95].

Moreover, recent studies have expanded the ROM's application to complex scenarios involving residential battery systems [46], emphasizing the importance of considering various sources of uncertainty, compound options, and computational approaches in evaluating these investments. The integration of machine learning methods with Monte Carlo power flow analysis in these models demonstrates a novel approach to managing the computational challenges associated with such complex evaluations [46].

The influence of information systems and smart technologies, like smart meters and load control switches, in managing electricity demand and providing flexibility, is another crucial aspect. This flexibility, particularly in response to the fluctuating nature of renewable energy sources, holds significant economic value and is aptly assessed using the Real Options Theory [122].

The Real Options Approach (ROA) has also been effectively applied in agent-based models to simulate the diffusion of residential PVs in various market conditions, emphasizing the value of flexibility in managing investment volatility [93]. This approach provides insights into optimal subsidy intensities and the effectiveness of policy suggestions in promoting PV diffusion [93].

Additionally, the timing of investments in residential distributed energy resource projects has been studied using the ROA, considering the decline in initial costs and maximizing profitability. This approach addresses the flexibility value in making investments and uses Monte Carlo simulation for electricity price prediction [113].

In summary, the relationship among these keywords centers around the strategic evaluation of investments in the energy sector, particularly in PV technology and smart grids. It entails considering investment timing, size, and flexibility in the face of market uncertainties and dynamic interactions, incorporating innovative financial frameworks and computational methods [78][9][120][81][28][1][95][46][122][93][113].

In the field of energy markets, especially in the context of photovoltaic (PV) technology and smart grids, there exist intricate and dynamic relationships among various key concepts. These relationships play a crucial role in shaping investment decisions and strategies. Let's explore these relationships in more detail:
