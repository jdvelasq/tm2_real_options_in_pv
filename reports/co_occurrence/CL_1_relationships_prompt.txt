Title: valuing chinese FEED_IN_TARIFFS program for SOLAR_POWER_GENERATION: a
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
Abstract:
```
combustion of COAL_ACCOUNTS for about 75% of TOTAL_POWER_GENERATION in
CHINA. the GLOBAL_CALL for CO2_EMISSIONS_REDUCTION, exposure to OIL_RISKS
and their bearing on ENERGY_SECURITY, require CHINA to properly determine
its FUTURE_ENERGY_POLICIES. this study has attempted to quantify the
benefits provided by current chinese feed_in tariff (fit) policy for
SOLAR_POWER_GENERATION by using REAL_OPTION PRICING approach to estimate
the value of SOLAR_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in the face of
UNCERTAIN_FOSSIL_FUEL_PRICES and learning effects in SOLAR_TECHNOLOGIES.
the OPTIMAL_SOLUTION as calculated renders the governments FIT_EFFORT as
a SUFFICIENT_MECHANISM to make SOLAR an economically
COMPETITIVE_ALTERNATIVE in CHINAS_ENERGY FUTURE. in addition,
OPTIONS_VALUES in terms of internalized EXTERNAL_COSTS and variation in
the level of fit are also compared. SIMULATION_RESULTS reveal the
OPTIONS_VALUE to be significantly greater when EXTERNAL_COSTS are
internalized. nevertheless, it was found that the
AVERAGE_CURRENT_FIT_LEVEL is non_optimal, and should be increased to
between 1.5 rmb/kwh and 1.7 rmb/kwh to ensure
MAXIMUM_INVESTMENT_INCENTIVE with MINIMAL_GOVERNMENT_EXPENDITURES.
furthermore, given SOLAR to be an ATTRACTIVE_ALTERNATIVE for the FUTURE,
his STUDY_HYPOTHESIZES that SOLAR_POWER_USE in CHINA can potentially
reduce CO2_EMISSIONS by approximately 1.3% by 2020 compared to the 2005
level.  2013 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

Title: INVESTMENT in WIND_POWER and PUMPED_STORAGE in a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL
Abstract:
```
promoting RENEWABLE_ENERGY has been a KEY_INGREDIENT in ENERGY_POLICY
seeking to de_carbonize the ENERGY_MIX and will continue to do so in the
FUTURE given the EUROPEAN_UNION's high ambitions to further
CURB_CARBON_EMISSIONS. a WIDE_RANGE of instruments has been suggested and
implemented in VARIOUS_COUNTRIES of the eu. a PROMINENT_POLICY promoting
INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_TECHNOLOGIES is the use of feed_in tariffs, which
has worked well at LARGE_SCALE in, e.g. GERMANY, but which has only been
implemented in a very limited way in countries such as the uk. being
subject to ENVIRONMENTAL_UNCERTAINTIES, however, RENEWABLES cannot be
seen in isolation: while renewables_based technologies such as WIND and
SOLAR_ENERGY, for example, suffer from UNCERTAIN_LOADS depending on
ENVIRONMENTAL_CONDITIONS, HYDROPOWER allows for the storage of water for
release at PEAK_PRICES, which can be treated as a premium (partially)
offsetting higher UPFRONT_INVESTMENT_COSTS. in addition,
ELECTRICITY_PRICES will respond to changes in ELECTRIC_CAPACITY in the
MARKET, which is often neglected in STANDARD_INVESTMENT_MODELS of the
ELECTRICITY_SECTOR. this PAPER_CONTRIBUTES to the existing literature in
two ways: it provides a review of a renewables_based TECHNOLOGY in a
SPECIFIC_POLICY_CONTEXT and provides ADDITIONAL_INSIGHT by employing a
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to investigate the SPECIFIC_CHARACTERISTICS of
RENEWABLES and their associated uncertainties in a stylized setting
taking explicitly into ACCOUNT_MARKET effects of INVESTMENT_DECISIONS.
the prices of the model are determined endogenously by the supply of
ELECTRICITY in the MARKET and by EXOGENOUS_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_UNCERTAINTY.
the inclusion of MARKET_EFFECTS allows us to capture the FULL_IMPACT of
PUBLIC_INCENTIVES for companies to invest into WIND_POWER and hydro
pumped STORAGE_INSTALLATIONS.  2012 ELSEVIER_LTD. all rights reserved.

Title: INNOVATION_SUBSIDIES_VERSUS_CONSUMER_SUBSIDIES: a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
of SOLAR_ENERGY
Abstract:
```
given the interest in the commercialization of affordable,
CLEAN_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, we examine the prospects of
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV). we consider the question of how to transition
to a MEANINGFUL_PERCENTAGE of SOLAR_ENERGY in a SUSTAINABLE_MANNER and
which policies are most effective in accelerating adoption. this paper
develops a stochastic DYNAMIC_MODEL of the adoption of SOLAR_PV in the
residential and COMMERCIAL_SECTOR under two sources of UNCERTAINTY _ the
price of ELECTRICITY and COST of SOLAR. the ANALYTIC_RESULTS suggest that
a HIGH_RATE of INNOVATION may DELAY_ADOPTION of a NEW_TECHNOLOGY if the
consumer has RATIONAL_PRICE_EXPECTATIONS. we simulate the model across
ALTERNATIVE_RATES_TECHNOLOGICAL change, ELECTRICITY_PRICES, subsidies and
CARBON_TAXES. it is shown that there will be a displacement of
INCUMBENT_TECHNOLOGIES and a widespread shift towards SOLAR_PV in under
30 YEARS _ and that this can occur without CONSUMER_INCENTIVES and CARBON
PRICING. we show that these policies have a MODEST_IMPACT in accelerating
adoption, and that they may not be an EFFECTIVE_PART of CLIMATE_POLICY.
instead, results demonstrate that further TECHNOLOGICAL_CHANGE is the
CRUCIAL_DETERMINANT and MAIN_DRIVER of adoption. further, results
indicate that subsidies and taxes become increasingly ineffective with
higher rates of TECHNOLOGICAL_CHANGE.  2016.

Title: BENEFIT_EVALUATION of INVESTMENT in CCS_RETROFITTING of COAL fired
POWER_PLANTS and PV_POWER_PLANTS in CHINA based on REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
coal_fired POWER_PLAYS an IMPORTANT_ROLE in CHINA's power supply, even
though the PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) power has developed rapidly in RECENT_YEARS.
CARBON_CAPTURE_AND_STORAGE (ccs) TECHNOLOGY is essential for achieving
anticipated long_term CLIMATE_CHANGE MITIGATION_TARGETS. however, CHINA's
GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY policies tend to SUPPORT_PV, while incentives for ccs
are few. given this situation, a TRINOMIAL_TREE modeling_based
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH was developed to evaluate
CCS_RETROFITTING_INVESTMENT in coal_fired
POWER_PLANTS_VERSUS_PV_POWER_INVESTMENT. this model includes setting
DIFFERENT_POLICY_SCENARIOS by considering ELECTRICITY_TARIFF_SUBSIDIES
and CHINESE_EMISSION trading scheme (cn_ets). the results showed that
coal_fired power with ccs has a COST_ADVANTAGE over PV_POWER in most
provinces in CHINA, if the ELECTRICITY_TARIFF and other SUBSIDY_POLICIES
remain the same; however, PV_POWER will be cheaper than coal_fired power
with ccs in yunnan, tianjin, hebei, shanghai and SHANXI_PROVINCES in the
ABOVE_CASES. incorporating ccs into cn_ets could cut the
former'S_APPLICATION_COST, but the INCENTIVE_EFFECT of cn_ets is not
obvious, because the CARBON_PRICE in CHINA is currently too cheap, and
the INCENTIVE_EFFECT of a POWER_TARIFF_SUBSIDY (SUBSIDY at the
PV_POWER_TARIFF_LEVEL) is much better for PV than for cn_ets. increasing
the LOAD_FACTOR is an IMPORTANT_WAY to reduce the CCS_APPLICATION_COST
for POWER_PLANTS. the results of this study provide reference and
guidance for the COLLABORATIVE_DEVELOPMENT of ccs and PV.  2019

Title: the impact of feed in TARIFF_DEGRESSION on r&D_INVESTMENT in
RENEWABLE_ENERGY: the case of the SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY
Abstract:
```
feed_in tariff (fit) is a broadly used POLICY_INSTRUMENT around the
world, in which the PAYMENT_LEVEL is always designed to decline gradually
in order to track and encourage TECHNOLOGICAL_IMPROVEMENT in
RENEWABLE_ENERGY. however, the POTENTIAL_ADVERSE_EFFECTS of
TARIFF_DEGRESSION on RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESEARCH and development (r&d)
INVESTMENT have not been sufficiently addressed. in this paper, we
explore the impact of FIT_PAYMENT_DEGRESSION on
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_R&D_INVESTMENT and analyze the
EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE for r&D_INVESTMENT. we form a MODELING
framework that captures the dynamics of FIT_PAYMENT_LEVELS and the
inventor's STRATEGIC_REACTIONS to TARIFF_CHANGES. in this framework, we
model the inventor's optimal r&D_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS based on the
canonical REAL_OPTION_APPROACH and simulate the impact of
FIT_PAYMENT_DEGRESSION on r&D_INVESTMENT and the
EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE under DIFFERENT_R&D_CHARACTERISTICS using
the case of the SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) industry. our results emphasize
the ADVERSE_EFFECT of TARIFF_DEGRESSION on the COMMERCIAL_VALUE of
NEW_RENEWABLE_TECHNOLOGY and hence the inventor's INCENTIVE in
r&D_INVESTMENT, especially when facing more TECHNICAL_UNCERTAINTY and
FINANCIAL_CONSTRAINTS. our model could help policymakers to DESIGN an
EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE through which the COST of the FIT_PROGRAM
is restricted to a MINIMUM_LEVEL but without influencing the inventor's
r&D_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: determining the value of GOVERNMENTAL_SUBSIDIES for the installation of
CLEAN_ENERGY_SYSTEMS using REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
limiting GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS has continually gained importance since
the KYOTO_PROTOCOL became effective in 2005. a variety of efforts have
been made to reduce ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and introduce supposedly clean and
RENEWABLE_ENERGY that can replace fossil fuelbased ENERGY_SOURCES.
however, many CLEAN_ENERGY_SOURCES are not economically viable by
themselves, and, therefore, GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDIES are necessary to provide
SUFFICIENT_ECONOMIC_MOTIVATION for the installation of NEW_TYPES of
ENERGY. for that reason, it is necessary to develop a method for
reasonably and accurately determining an APPROPRIATE_LEVEL of
GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY for PRIVATE_ENTITIES. in this paper we propose a real
option_based framework for rationally quantifying the amount of
GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY required by PRIVATE_ENTITIES in order to implement a
CLEAN_ENERGY_GENERATION_SYSTEM. a CASE_STUDY that involved the
installation of a PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM in an AVERAGE_HOUSEHOLD in seoul,
KOREA was conducted in order to verify the proposed framework. the
proposed framework is expected to help ENERGY_POLICYMAKERS choose the
PROPER_LEVEL of GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY that will effectively encourage
PRIVATE_ENTITIES to install CLEAN_ENERGY_SYSTEMS without wasting
taxpayers' money.  2012 AMERICAN_SOCIETY of CIVIL_ENGINEERS.

Title: OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIO_STRATEGIES for POWER_ENTERPRISES under multi
POLICY_SCENARIOS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY
Abstract:
```
planning a portfolio that includes
DIFFERENT_POWER_GENERATION_TECHNOLOGIES is an IMPORTANT_METHOD to ensure
expected value and to reduce RISKS for the PROJECT_INVESTMENT of
electric_power enterprises. this PAPER_EVALUATES the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIO_STRATEGIES implemented by
ELECTRIC_POWER_ENTERPRISES by using REAL_OPTION and
PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_METHODS. the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD is used to
GENERATE_INVESTMENT_VALUES and their distribution. these serve as the
INPUT_VARIABLES of the PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_MODEL. the
PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_MODEL is built based on the CONDITIONAL_VALUE at
RISK. the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT is analyzed by considering four
POLICY_SCENARIOS: different expected INVESTMENT_VALUES, the phase_out of
subsidies, tightened CARBON_REDUCTION_STANDARDS, and
DIFFERENT_INITIAL_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATE_PRICES. a CASE_STUDY is
conducted to analyze the INVESTMENT_DECISION of an
ELECTRIC_POWER_ENTERPRISE in CHINA. the results show the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIO_STRATEGY, the INVESTMENT_VALUE, and the
CONDITIONAL_VALUE at RISK. the OPTIMAL_DECISION for ensuring a relatively
high expected value while reducing RISKS is to increase the share of
SOLAR_PV_POWER_GENERATION and WIND POWER_GENERATION in
CURRENT_CONDITIONS. tightened CARBON_REDUCTION_STANDARDS and higher
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES_PRICES are conductive to increase the
INVESTMENT_VALUE, reduce the RISK of loss and increase the share of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POWER_GENERATION. in contrast, the phase_out of the
subsidies had the OPPOSITE_EFFECT. the methodology and results can
provide a reference for investors to guide the formulation of the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISION and for the GOVERNMENT to optimize the
POLICY_EFFECT.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: a comparison of the REGIONAL_INVESTMENT_BENEFITS of CCS_RETROFITTING of
COAL fired POWER_PLANTS and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS in CHINA
Abstract:
```
CARBON_DIOXIDE (co2) capture and storage (ccs) TECHNOLOGY and
RENEWABLE_POWER are indispensable in CHINA's power sector to limit
GLOBAL_WARMING to 2c. because the two technologies have their OWN_MERITS
and weaknesses, it is important to understand their INVESTMENT_BENEFITS
and choose a cost_effective portfolio. therefore, we conducted an
INVESTMENT_EVALUATION of CCS_RETROFITTING of coal_fired POWER_PLANTS
(cfpp) with HYPOTHETICAL_SUBSIDIES and
RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS (rpp) by using a
REAL_OPTION_TRINOMIAL_TREE PRICING model and compared their
ECONOMIC_BENEFITS in DIFFERENT_PROVINCES in CHINA. the results showed
that when subsidies for the DESULFURIZATION_PRICE or the feed_in tariff
of WIND_POWER were adopted, the CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp did not achieve
the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_VALUE, even in 2027. if the decarbonized
ELECTRICITY_PRICE_INCREASES to 0.75 cny/kwh, equal to the feed_in tariff
of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC and BIOMASS_POWER, the CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp
would be commercially viable, and their INVESTMENT_VALUE would exceed
that of WIND POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS. in this situation, ningxia,
xinjiang, and GANSU_PROVINCES would be most suitable for the development
of CCS_RETROFITTING PILOT_PROJECTS; the advantages of the
CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp were not significant, WHEREAS_RPP was a better
INVESTMENT_CHOICE in many provinces. this paper provides a perspective on
feed_in tariffs for POLICY_MAKERS to use in formulating a SUBSIDY_SYSTEM
to support the development of ccs in CHINA, with POLICY_IMPLICATIONS for
other countries.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY for SOLAR_PV_INTEGRATION in
RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS: a CASE_STUDY in the PHILIPPINES
Abstract:
```
in DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, particularly in RURAL_AREAS, LONG_PERIODS of
POWER_OUTAGES are experienced as the ELECTRICITY_GRID is technically or
economically unfeasible. as SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) is the most potential
and SUITABLE_SOURCE of RENEWABLE_ENERGY for these areas, this
PAPER_ANALYZES the ECONOMIC_VIABILITY of its INTEGRATION in
DIFFERENT_TYPES of RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS. applying REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH
under UNCERTAINTY in ELECTRICITY_PRICES, this STUDY_COMPARES the
attractiveness of adopting SOLAR_PV over continuing ELECTRICITY from the
grid focusing on VARIOUS_INVESTMENT_PAYMENT_SCHEMES including (i)
FULL_PAYMENT, (ii) distributed payment for 5 or 10 YEARS without a down
payment, and (iii) distributed payment for 5 or 10 YEARS with 20% or 40%
down payment. applying the model with the case of the PHILIPPINES, the
results with the FULL_PAYMENT_STRATEGY obtain OPTION_VALUES of usd 6888
for building type_i, usd 15349 for building type_ii, usd 21204 for
building type_iii, usd 27870 for building type_iv, and usd 34251 for
building type_v. these OPTION_VALUES_INCREASE by 21.6% and 22.5% with
distributed PAYMENT_SCHEME to a 5_or 10_year period and increase by 5%
and 13% for distributed payment with 40% and 20% down payment. these
OPTION_VALUES decrease with INVESTMENTS at later periods. contrary to the
CONVENTIONAL_OPTION_VALUATION_RESULTS of an OPTIMAL_DECISION to wait, our
findings show the otherwise as earlier INVESTMENT_REDUCES the RISK of
OPPORTUNITY_LOSS from delaying the adoption of SOLAR_PV. among the
PAYMENT_SCHEMES analyzed, the distribution of PV_SYSTEM_COST in a 10_year
installment period without down PAYMENT_SHOWS to be the most
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY which may encourage lower_income and
risk_averse consumers whose decision to adopt SOLAR_PV is affected by
COST_BARRIERS, ECONOMIC_STATUS, and HOUSEHOLD_INCOME. the STUDY_SUGGESTS
the GOVERNMENT, particularly in DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, to support the
INTEGRATION of own_use SOLAR_PV in BUILDINGS through incentives and
subsidies, as well as FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS to offer more
AFFORDABLE_TERMS of payment that encourages low to
MEDIUM_INCOME_HOUSEHOLDS to adopt SOLAR_PV. further, this will not only
augment the ENERGY_DEFICIENCY in these countries but also support the
GLOBAL_ASPIRATIONS of reducing GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS and its
ADVERSE_EFFECTS through gradually shifting to RENEWABLE_SOURCES of
ENERGY.  2021. the authors. published by cbiore.

Title: application of REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION for analysing the impact of
PUBLIC_R&d FINANCING on RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PROJECTS: a COMPANYS_PERSPECTIVE
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_CONTRASTS the FINANCIAL_BENEFIT of grants given to RESEARCH
and DEVELOPMENT_PROJECTS with the reduction in MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY
they impose, which implies a loss in the value of the project. to
quantify this loss of value, REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS has been adopted as
the most SUITABLE_FRAMEWORK to assess and
QUANTIFY_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY. this idea is illustrated by the case of
a RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_PROJECT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY, specifically
concentrated SOLAR_POWER. our results show that the value added by the
grants is less than the NOMINAL_INCENTIVES received as a result of the
loss of FLEXIBILITY for MANAGERS; they cannot apply CERTAIN_OPTIONS such
as deferral, nor can they abandon the project. therefore, a break_even
grant is proposed that equals the FINANCIAL_INCENTIVE with the loss of
MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY. under this break_even point, the grant should be
rejected. this paper will create awareness for both POLICY_MAKERS and
PRIVATE_COMPANIES regarding a more ACCURATE_ASSESSMENT of grants to
RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT FUNDING as well as provide insights to improve
GRANT_SCHEMES without increasing the amount of PUBLIC_FUNDS.  2016

Abstract:
```
this PAPER_APPLIES the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD to analyse the
DEFER_OPTION_VALUE and OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING for
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS in CHINA. the MAIN_PURPOSE of this paper is
to examine INVESTMENT_BEHAVIOURS under DIFFERENT_MARKET_SYSTEMS and
SUPPORT_SCHEMES. this paper further investigates the interaction of
TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and SUPPORT_SCHEMES. four scenarios are designed,
and the CORRESPONDING_REAL_OPTIONS_MODELS are established. in the
CASE_STUDY, we find that ELECTRICITY_MARKET_REFORM_ENHANCES the
DEFER_OPTION_VALUE in the SHORT_TERM but makes the owners of
SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS_POSTPONE their INVESTMENT. nevertheless, the GOVERNMENT
can STIMULATE_INVESTMENT by implementing APPROPRIATE_SUPPORT_SCHEMES.
additionally, the impacts of DIFFERENT_SUPPORT_SCHEMES vary according to
the MARKET_SYSTEM. the impacts of feed_in tariffs and PRICE_PREMIUMS are
similar in a regulated MARKET but are different in a FREE_MARKET. the
PRICE_PREMIUM_SCHEME greatly promotes the DEFER_OPTION_VALUES in the
SHORT_TERM, but the feed_in tariff scheme excels in the LONG_TERM. a
feed_in tariff has a greater impact on reducing the expected
EXECUTION_TIME and its variance than the PRICE_PREMIUM. in addition, more
ATTRACTIVE_SUPPORT_SCHEMES are required when the TECHNOLOGICAL_LEVEL is

INVESTMENT_EXPENDITURES in WIND and SOLAR_ENERGIES in INDIA.
RECENT_INCREASES in CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and INVESTMENTS by both the public
and PRIVATE_SECTORS along with GOVERNMENT_SUPPORT_SCHEMES have made these
energies more competitive with traditional FUELS like COAL in generating
ELECTRICITY. we use a two_factor LEARNING_CURVE to model the decline in
prices of WIND and SOLAR_ENERGIES. employing a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH with
GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES as the STOCHASTIC_VARIABLE we find the OVERALL_VALUE
of PROMOTION_POLICIES in RENEWABLES to be sufficiently large. the
TRIGGER_PRICE of COAL for INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGIES today for
ELECTRICITY_GENERATION suggest early to IMMEDIATE_DEPLOYMENT of
ADDITIONAL_WIND and SOLAR_TECHNOLOGIES as the OPTIMAL_POLICY. with the
option to deploy for a longer TIME_HORIZON, continuing with
PROMOTION_POLICIES of CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and INVESTMENT_EXPENDITURES in
RENEWABLES is more valuable at HIGH_GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES.  2020

Title: value of INVESTMENT in a MICROGRID under UNCERTAINTY in the FUEL_PRICE
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_DISCUSSES_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES in a MICROGRID_SYSTEM
consisting of COGENERATION_SYSTEM and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION under
UNCERTAINTY in the NATURAL_GAS_PRICE. although incentives for introducing
distributed ENERGY_SYSTEM_INCREASE these days, volatile
NATURAL_GAS_PRICES make its INVESTMENT in GAS_FUEL distributed
GENERATION_SYSTEMS_RISKY. therefore, it is important to evaluate the RISK
under UNCERTAINTY and find FLEXIBLE_STRATEGIES which reduce the exposure
to FUEL_PRICE_VOLATILITY. we take the REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to
ANALYZE_INVESTMENT_DECISION. by varying the parameter of
PRICE_VOLATILITY, we find that the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY depends on
the level of UNCERTAINTY. as VOLATILITY_INCREASES, strategies with
INSTALLATION_OPTION of RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION, here,
PHOTOVOLTAIC_GENERATION, become attractive in terms of RISK_REDUCTION.

Title: the effect of current and PROSPECTIVE_POLICIES on
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM_ECONOMICS: an application to the us MIDWEST
Abstract:
```
this STUDY_MODELS FUNDAMENTAL_FEATURES of current and
PROSPECTIVE_POLICIES ENCOURAGING_ADOPTION of RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC
(PV) systems. a key finding is that time_of_day (tod) PRICING can enhance
or worsen the ECONOMICS of PV_SYSTEMS. moreover, increased responsiveness
of ELECTRICITY_DEMAND to its PRICE_DIMINISHES the effectiveness of tod
PRICING in the absence of net metering, but does not affect it otherwise.
an application to PLAUSIBLE_CONDITIONS in the state of INDIANA, usa,
shows that CURRENT_POLICIES are unlikely to TRIGGER_ADOPTION by a
risk_neutral forward_looking RESIDENTIAL_CUSTOMER. however, adoption of
PV_SYSTEMS can be induced if the FEDERAL_TAX_CREDIT is increased to cover
48% of CAPITAL_COST (instead of the current 30%), which could imply a
COST to the FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT of about $0.95/kw of INSTALLED_CAPACITY
depending on the panel's size. we demonstrate that implementation of tod
PRICING can TRIGGER_ADOPTION under a range of on_ and off_peak price
combinations. but our analysis also shows that the cost_effectiveness of
tod PRICING is enhanced at higher ratios of on_peak to off_peak prices.

Title: energiewende @ RISK: on the continuation of RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION at
the end of PUBLIC_POLICY_SUPPORT
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_AIMS to analyze what happens with
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POWER_PLANTS, such as onshore WIND, PHOTOVOLTAICS and
biomass, when the PUBLIC_POLICY_SUPPORT based on the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_LAW
expires. with its expiration, the first RENEWABLE_ENERGY (and especially
onshore WIND) POWER_PLANTS will have to be scrutinized as to whether they
can economically continue operation, whether they have to be repowered,
or whether they need to be decommissioned. the RELATIVE_MERITS of these
three alternatives are evaluated by applying REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS. in
contrast to TRADITIONAL_PROJECT_EVALUATION_TECHNIQUES, the
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH takes advantage of the use of UNCERTAIN_PARAMETERS
included in the model, such as the development of the ELECTRICITY_PRICE
or ELECTRICITY_OUTPUT. the results obtained suggest that parameters such
as the level of FUTURE_OPERATION and MAINTENANCE_COSTS, the expected
development of the ELECTRICITY_PRICE at the SPOT_MARKET, and the
interrelations between these, as well as the development of the
ELECTRICITY_OUTPUT from RENEWABLES can significantly affect the
PROFITABILITY of these POWER_PLANTS and thus impact the decision about
their further OPTIMAL_OPERATION.  2019 by the authors.

Title: price and SUBSIDY under UNCERTAINTY: REAL_OPTION_APPROACH to
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS on ENERGY_STORAGE with SOLAR_PV
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_GENERATION_SOURCES still have not achieved ECONOMIC_VALIDITY in
many countries including KOREA, and require subsidies to support the
transition to a low_carbon economy. an initial feed_in tariff (fit) was
adopted to support the deployment of RENEWABLE_ENERGY in KOREA until 2011
and then was switched to the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard (rps) to
implement more market_oriented MECHANISMS. however, HIGH_VOLATILITIES in
ELECTRICITY_PRICES and subsidies under the RPS_SCHEME have weakened
INVESTMENT_INCENTIVES. in this study we estimate how the
MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES under the RPS_SCHEME affect the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS of ENERGY_STORAGE_PROJECTS, whose importance
is increasing rapidly because they can mitigate the variability and
UNCERTAINTY of SOLAR and WIND generation in the POWER_SYSTEM. we applied
MATHEMATICAL_ANALYSIS based on real_option methods to estimate the
OPTIMAL_TRIGGER_PRICE for INVESTMENT in energy_storage projects with and
without MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES. we found that the
OPTIMAL_TRIGGER_PRICE of SUBSIDY called the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATE
(rec) under MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES is 10.5% higher than that under
no PRICE_VOLATILITIES. if the VOLATILITY of the REC_PRICE gets doubled,
the project requires a 26.6% higher OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PRICE to justify
the INVESTMENT against the increased RISK. in the end, we propose an
AUCTION_SCHEME that has the advantage of both rps and fit in order to
minimize the FINANCIAL_BURDEN of the SUBSIDY_PROGRAM by eliminating
SUBSIDY_VOLATILITY and find the minimum willingness_to_accept price for
investors.  the author(s) 2021.

Title: how to promote the WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of
PHOTOVOLTAIC_MICROGRIDS under INVESTMENT_UNCERTAINTY? a
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS in CHINA
Abstract:
```
MICROGRIDS can integrate the PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_PROCESS of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY and realize the SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT of
POWER_SYSTEMS. however, it remains difficult to promote the
WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_MICROGRIDS due to
HIGH_COSTS. this study develops a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for it to assess
peak_valley ELECTRICITY_PRICES and ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES under the
uncertainties in the INITIAL_INVESTMENT dynamic. the ADJUSTMENT_MECHANISM
is also established in the REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL to analyze the tendency of
INCENTIVE_POLICIES changing with UNCERTAINTY. the results demonstrate
that the OPTIMAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES of 31 provinces in
CHINA_RANGE from 0.30 rmb/kwh to 1.05 rmb/kwh, and the OPTIMAL_RATES of
peak_valley price range from 3.09 to 6.32. on this basis, we conduct a
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS of OPTIMAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY and peak_valley
price rate and find that the threshold goes down significantly as the
COST goes down. however, RAPID_COST_VARIATIONS and fluctuations make
DEVELOPERS_HESITATE to invest, which will seriously hinder the
WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of PV_MICROGRIDS. this study extends the
understanding of participants' strategies in a DYNAMIC_FRAMEWORK by
analyzing the impacts of UNCERTAINTY on INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. we suggest
developers pay attention to the changes in the MARKET and reduce
INVESTMENT_RISKS by signing OPTION_CONTRACTS. a
STABLE_INVESTMENT_MARKET_CORRESPONDS to smaller peak_valley price rates
and less ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES. the policy_maker should provide
flexible and EFFICIENT_INCENTIVES depending on the APPLICATION_SCENARIO.
it is also suggested that in areas lacking SOLAR_RESOURCES, the
GOVERNMENT should not only speed up the establishment of peak_valley
ELECTRICITY_PRICES but also provide long_term subsidies.  2022

Title: DECISION_SUPPORT for INVESTMENTS in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES under
uncertainties
Abstract:
```
INVESTMENT in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES is one of the
CLIMATE_MITIGATION_STRATEGIES that can significantly reduce
GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS in the ENERGY_SECTOR. however, in
DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, INVESTMENT is challenged by
HIGH_CAPITAL_EXPENDITURES and several uncertainties. this PAPER_AIMS to
provide DECISION_SUPPORT for INVESTMENT in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_PROJECTS by
evaluating the COMPARATIVE_ATTRACTIVENESS of shifting ENERGY_SOURCES from
FOSSIL_FUELS to RENEWABLES and nuclear. applying the
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH (ROA), this PAPER_CALCULATES the value of the
FLEXIBILITY to postpone the INVESTMENT_DECISION and identifies the
OPTIMAL_TIMING (described here as the TRIGGER_PRICE of COAL) for shifting
to SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. then, VARIOUS_UNCERTAINTIES are
considered, such as COAL and ELECTRICITY_PRICES, NEGATIVE_EXTERNALITY of
using FOSSIL_FUELS, and the RISK of a NUCLEAR_ACCIDENT, which are
modelled using GEOMETRIC_BROWNIAN_MOTION, POISSON_PROCESS, and
BERNOULLI_PROBABILITY. applying the ROA_MODEL in the case of the
PHILIPPINES, results find that investing in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY is a
better option than continuing to use COAL for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION.
however, contrary to CONVENTIONAL_OPTION_VALUATION_RESULT that waiting is
a better strategy, this study found that delaying or postponing the
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS may lead to POSSIBLE_OPPORTUNITY_LOSSES. among the
AVAILABLE_SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES, geothermal is the most attractive
with TRIGGER_PRICES of COAL equal to usd 49.95/ton, followed by nuclear
(usd 58.55/ton), WIND (usd 69.48/ton), SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (usd
72.04/ton), and HYDROPOWER (usd 111.14/ton). also, the occurrence of jump
(extreme) prices of COAL, raising the current feed_in_tariff, and
considering NEGATIVE_EXTERNALITIES can decrease the TRIGGER_PRICES, which
FAVOR_INVESTMENTS in SUSTAINABLE_ENERGIES. moreover, the RISK of a
NUCLEAR_DISASTER favors INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES over
nuclear due to the HUGE_DAMAGE_COSTS once an ACCIDENT_OCCURS. results
provide bases for POLICY_RECOMMENDATIONS toward achieving a more secure
and SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_SECTOR for DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES that are highly
dependent on imported FOSSIL_FUELS.  2022. the authors.

the purpose of MICROGRIDS is to improve SYSTEM_FLEXIBILITY and RESILIENCE

CEASELESS_LOAD_GROWTH_MANDATES to increase MICROGRID's capacity, thereby
improving the SYSTEM_FLEXIBILITY and RESILIENCE. however,
CAPACITY_EXPANSION requires SIGNIFICANT_INVESTMENTS, making it essential
to identify the OPTIMAL_CAPACITY of ENERGY_RESOURCES. the methodologies
proposed in the LITERATURE_IDENTIFIES the MICROGRID's capacity with an
assumption of INVESTMENTS with a single installment. this way of
THEORETICAL_APPROACH leads to UNREALISTIC_SOLUTIONS. besides, MICROGRID's
participation in a FLEXIBLE_MARKET will enhance its performance both in
commercial and TECHNICAL_ASPECTS. therefore, this paper proposes a
REALISTIC_FRAMEWORK with the concept 'expansion through time' inspired by
'REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY.' this framework includes PRACTICAL_PARAMETERS like
RESOURCE_LOAD_UNCERTAINTY, PHYSICAL_SPACE required to install, revenue
generated by resources, and MAXIMUM_DEMAND_PENALTY, on top of
ELECTRICAL_PARAMETERS; constrained with SIGNIFICANT_RETURN in INVESTMENTS
to improve the OVERALL_SAVINGS. in addition, this paper proposes a
MARKET_PARTICIPATION_MODEL for MICROGRID, which defines a bidding process
with two components, such as regular and FLEXIBLE_PORTIONS under both
normal and EXTREME_CONDITIONS. this STUDY_CONSIDERS renewable_based

Title: a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to assessing the COST_SAVINGS_POTENTIAL of

Abstract:
```
small and MEDIUM_SCALE_ENTERPRISES (smes) are integral to
ECONOMIC_DEVELOPMENT. however, they face significant challenges within
their operations, of which access to an AFFORDABLE_POWER supply is
profound. self_generation options have the potential to curtail these
challenges to an extent, but SMES_NEED to choose options that provide
SIGNIFICANT_COST_SAVINGS. this study proposes a simulation_based
REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL using SECONDARY_DATA to evaluate the
COST_SAVINGS_POTENTIAL for smes in switching from CONVENTIONAL_POWER
generating sources to RENEWABLE_ENERGY based on three MAIN_SCENARIOS:
using RENEWABLE_ENERGY as a backup; a COMPLETE_TRANSITION to
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION; and a PARTIAL_TRANSITION to
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES. the results show that using RENEWABLE_ENERGY as
BACKUP_SOURCES of ENERGY does not provide SIGNIFICANT_COST_SAVINGS to the
sme. however, a complete or a PARTIAL_TRANSITION from conventional to
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESOURCES offers SUBSTANTIAL_COST_SAVINGS for the sme
over the life of the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGY. smes must consider
CAPACITY_FACTORS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, tariffs for
CONVENTIONAL_POWER supply, SYSTEM_RELIABILITY of CONVENTIONAL_SYSTEMS,
and the INVESTMENT_COSTS for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION as critical
determining factors for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS.
SUCCESSFUL_INTEGRATION of RENEWABLE_ENERGY by smes also requires
POLICY_SUPPORT towards educating smes on its importance and
TECHNICAL_REQUIREMENTS. KEY_POLICY_INSIGHTS RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INTEGRATION
can allow smes to make SUBSTANTIAL_SAVINGS in their
POWER_CONSUMPTION_COSTS. smes must be mindful of an approach towards
investing in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES so that it also maximises

Title: statistical decision theoretic RISK_MANAGEMENT for planning
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PATHWAYS
Abstract:
```
the world has witnessed an increase in the level of INVESTMENTS for
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in the PAST_DECADE mainly owing to the
pressure for mitigating GREENHOUSE_GAS (ghg) EMISSIONS, whilst addressing
the issue of CLIMATE_CHANGE. according to RECENT_STATISTICS,
GLOBAL_INVESTMENTS edged up by 2 % in 2019 to $301.7 billion, taking the
value of CUMULATIVE_INVESTMENTS since 2004 to $3.5 trillion, which has
been attributed to the falling COSTS of SOLAR and WIND technologies. with
the commissioning of ADDITIONAL_CAPACITIES from RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES
each year, there is a growing need for managing the associated
RISKS_AND_UNCERTAINTIES from the perspective of DIFFERENT_STAKEHOLDERS
throughout the planning, development and OPERATIONAL_PHASES.
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES entail CONSIDERABLE_TECHNOLOGICAL and
FINANCIAL_RISKS_EXPOSURE, depending on the location where the
technologies are implemented, and thus needs to be managed using
techniques that would provide both the quantification of RISKS and
OPTIMAL_DECISIONS that lead to RISK MITIGATION. the objective of the
proposed RESEARCH is to develop a PROBABILISTIC_FRAMEWORK which broadly
includes: (a) statistical modelling of FINANCIAL_RISKS _ such as
variability of revenue due to ELECTRICITY_PRICE, DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS,
GENERATION_COSTS, or other MARKET_CONDITIONS; and (b) evaluating options
that maximise the stakeholders utility/reward functions, or
MINIMISE_RISKS, for a given TECHNOLOGY_MIX. this RESEARCH_DEMONSTRATES
the implementation of BINOMIAL_LATTICE_MODEL in REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
(ROA) for the VALUATION of INVESTMENTS on diversified ENERGY_PORTFOLIOS.
the framework is applied to analyse the impact of RISKS_AND_UNCERTAINTIES
on CAPITAL budgeting decisions relating to PROJECT_SIZE (expand or
contract); PROJECT_LIFE and timing (initiation, deferment or abandon);
and PROJECT_OPERATION (FLEXIBILITY in the TECHNOLOGY_MIX) for scenarios
involving large_scale deployment of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES.  2021

Abstract:
```
CCS_TECHNOLOGY is significant to achieve CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION in the
current coal_based ENERGY_MIX in CHINA, just as PV received more
POLICY_SUBSIDIES from the CHINESE_GOVERNMENT to promote its
INDUSTRY_DEVELOPMENT in the EARLY_STAGE, and all parties in the society,
including the GOVERNMENT and enterprises, have paid attention to and
supported the development of CCS_TECHNOLOGY to promote the implementation
of CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION. this PAPER_EVALUATES the
REGIONAL_INVESTMENT_BENEFITS and INVESTMENT_TIMING of CCS_RETROFITTING
and rtdpv in DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS for each province in CHINA based on the
REAL_OPTION_APPROACH. the results show that the INITIAL_COST_SUBSIDY and
participation in the CARBON_MARKET are not as effective as the feed_in
tariff SUBSIDY, and the INVESTMENT_RETURN of CCS_RETROFIT is better than
rtdpv in the scenario with feed_in tariff SUBSIDY, and most provinces can
achieve IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT. rtdpv without subsidies cannot achieve
FULL_PARITY nationwide yet, and some provinces are not suitable for
INVESTMENT without participating in the CARBON_MARKET. the net
PRESENT_VALUE_APPROACH would underestimate the INVESTMENT_VALUE of ccs
and rtdpv and prematurely REJECT_INVESTMENT in many scenarios, while
provinces under the REAL_OPTION_APPROACH tend to DELAY_INVESTMENT to
obtain OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_RETURNS. this paper provides a reference for
investors to make INVESTMENT_DECISIONS in low_carbon technologies and for
governments to develop CCS_INCENTIVES. copyright  2022 yang, cui, he and

Title: RISK_ASSESSMENT of INVESTMENT_STRATEGY in distributed ENERGY_SYSTEM under
UNCERTAINTY of fuel and ELECTRICITY_PRICES
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_DISCUSSES_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES in distributed ENERGY_SYSTEM
consisting of COGENERATION_SYSTEM and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION, under
UNCERTAINTY in the NATURAL_GAS and the ELECTRICITY_PRICES as well as
related RISK_ASSESSMENT of INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES. although incentives for
introducing distributed ENERGY_SYSTEM_INCREASE these days, volatile
NATURAL_GAS_PRICES make its INVESTMENT_RISKY. therefore, it is important
to evaluate the RISK under UNCERTAINTY and find strategies which reduce
the exposure to VOLATILITY. we take the REAL_OPTION_APPROACH to
ANALYZE_INVESTMENT_DECISION. by varying the parameters of
PRICES_VOLATILITY and correlation between UNCERTAINTY of
NATURAL_GAS_PRICE with that of ELECTRICITY_PRICE, we find that the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY depends on the level of UNCERTAINTY and
correlation. when VOLATILITY is large and correlation is small,
strategies with INSTALLATION_OPTION of SMALL_RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION,
here, PHOTOVOLTAIC_GENERATION, and SMALL_COGENERATION_SYSTEM become
attractive in terms of RISK_REDUCTION.
