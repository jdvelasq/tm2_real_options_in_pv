Title: INNOVATION_SUBSIDIES_VERSUS_CONSUMER_SUBSIDIES: a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
of SOLAR_ENERGY
Abstract:
```
given the interest in the commercialization of affordable,
CLEAN_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, we examine the prospects of
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV). we consider the question of how to transition
to a MEANINGFUL_PERCENTAGE of SOLAR_ENERGY in a SUSTAINABLE_MANNER and
which policies are most effective in accelerating adoption. this paper
develops a stochastic DYNAMIC_MODEL of the adoption of SOLAR_PV in the
residential and COMMERCIAL_SECTOR under two sources of UNCERTAINTY _ the
price of ELECTRICITY and COST of SOLAR. the ANALYTIC_RESULTS suggest that
a HIGH_RATE of INNOVATION may DELAY_ADOPTION of a NEW_TECHNOLOGY if the
consumer has RATIONAL_PRICE_EXPECTATIONS. we simulate the model across
ALTERNATIVE_RATES_TECHNOLOGICAL change, ELECTRICITY_PRICES, subsidies and
CARBON_TAXES. it is shown that there will be a displacement of
INCUMBENT_TECHNOLOGIES and a widespread shift towards SOLAR_PV in under
30 YEARS _ and that this can occur without CONSUMER_INCENTIVES and CARBON
PRICING. we show that these policies have a MODEST_IMPACT in accelerating
adoption, and that they may not be an EFFECTIVE_PART of CLIMATE_POLICY.
instead, results demonstrate that further TECHNOLOGICAL_CHANGE is the
CRUCIAL_DETERMINANT and MAIN_DRIVER of adoption. further, results
indicate that subsidies and taxes become increasingly ineffective with
higher rates of TECHNOLOGICAL_CHANGE.  2016.

Title: the VALUATION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under
CARBON_MARKET_LINKAGE based on REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
this paper provides a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH to ANALYZE_INVESTMENT_VALUE
for PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under CARBON_MARKET_LINKAGE. the
PRIMARY_PURPOSE is to evaluate PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under
uncertainties from the perspective of POWER_GENERATION_ENTERPRISES.
uncertainties in INVESTMENT_COSTS, ELECTRICITY_PRICES, CARBON_PRICES and
SUBSIDY_PAYMENTS are considered. in addition, the MARKET co_movements of
INVESTMENT_COSTS are considered in this study. DUNHUANG is taken as a
CASE_STUDY to evaluate the value of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION through
SCENARIO_ANALYSIS. the RESULT_SHOWS that the INVESTMENT_VALUE of
PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION is negative. enterprise should give up the
INVESTMENT or DELAY_INVESTMENT until MATURE_CONDITIONS. moreover, the
INVESTMENT_VALUE can be improved by TECHNICAL_IMPROVEMENT, increasing a
CERTAIN_RANGE of SUBSIDY_PAYMENTS, etc. the RESEARCH presented would be
useful for PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT_EVALUATION and related
decision_marking.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: do SMART_GRIDS boost INVESTMENTS in DOMESTIC_PV_PLANTS? evidence from the
ITALIAN_ELECTRICITY_MARKET
Abstract:
```
large_scale development of distributed GENERATION_POWER_PLANTS has given
rise to NEW_CRITICAL_PROBLEMS for the DESIGN and MANAGEMENT of
ENERGY_SYSTEMS and ELECTRIC_GRIDS. it is commonly agreed that
CONTINGENT_PROBLEMS affecting LOCAL_GRIDS (e.g. inefficiency,
CONGESTION_RENTS, POWER_OUTAGES, etc.) may be solved by implementing
smarter ELECTRIC_GRIDS. SMART_GRIDS give producers and consumers, the
opportunity to be active in the MARKET and decide their optimal
PRODUCTION/consumption patterns strategically. this paper provides a
THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK MODELING prosumers' decision to invest in
PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS, assuming that they are integrated in
SMART_GRIDS. to capture the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, a
REAL_OPTION_APPROACH is implemented. the model was calibrated and tested
with data from the ITALIAN_ENERGY_MARKET. our findings show that the
possibility of selling ENERGY via the
SMART_GRID_INCREASES_INVESTMENT_VALUES. the connection to
SMART_GRIDS_INCREASES_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY: prosumers can optimally
exercise the option to decide the PROSUMPTION_QUOTA and switch from
prosumption to PRODUCTION. the opportunity to sell ENERGY in the
MARKET_ENCOURAGES_PROSUMERS to invest in a larger plant compared with
that needed for self_consumption, and there is a POSITIVE_RELATION
between OPTIMAL_SIZE and (optimal) INVESTMENT_TIMING.  2018 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: the impact of feed in TARIFF_DEGRESSION on r&D_INVESTMENT in
RENEWABLE_ENERGY: the case of the SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY
Abstract:
```
feed_in tariff (fit) is a broadly used POLICY_INSTRUMENT around the
world, in which the PAYMENT_LEVEL is always designed to decline gradually
in order to track and encourage TECHNOLOGICAL_IMPROVEMENT in
RENEWABLE_ENERGY. however, the POTENTIAL_ADVERSE_EFFECTS of
TARIFF_DEGRESSION on RENEWABLE_ENERGY_RESEARCH and development (r&d)
INVESTMENT have not been sufficiently addressed. in this paper, we
explore the impact of FIT_PAYMENT_DEGRESSION on
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_R&D_INVESTMENT and analyze the
EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE for r&D_INVESTMENT. we form a MODELING
framework that captures the dynamics of FIT_PAYMENT_LEVELS and the
inventor's STRATEGIC_REACTIONS to TARIFF_CHANGES. in this framework, we
model the inventor's optimal r&D_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS based on the
canonical REAL_OPTION_APPROACH and simulate the impact of
FIT_PAYMENT_DEGRESSION on r&D_INVESTMENT and the
EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE under DIFFERENT_R&D_CHARACTERISTICS using
the case of the SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) industry. our results emphasize
the ADVERSE_EFFECT of TARIFF_DEGRESSION on the COMMERCIAL_VALUE of
NEW_RENEWABLE_TECHNOLOGY and hence the inventor's INCENTIVE in
r&D_INVESTMENT, especially when facing more TECHNICAL_UNCERTAINTY and
FINANCIAL_CONSTRAINTS. our model could help policymakers to DESIGN an
EFFICIENT_FIT_PAYMENT_STRUCTURE through which the COST of the FIT_PROGRAM
is restricted to a MINIMUM_LEVEL but without influencing the inventor's
r&D_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS of a RESIDENTIAL_PV_SYSTEM from the TIMING_PERSPECTIVE:
a REAL_OPTION_MODEL
Abstract:
```
this paper proposes a NEW_MODEL for determining OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME
for RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_SYSTEMS. the model explicitly
incorporates the COST_UNCERTAINTY of the PV_SYSTEM and a RESIDENT's
option to DEFER_INVESTMENT, using a REAL_OPTION_MODEL. the paper provides
THEORETICAL_ANALYSIS as well as CASE_STUDIES. using the
REAL_OPTION_MODEL, we show that the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_THRESHOLD_DECREASES in case of VOLATILITY_INCREASE,
mean_drift decrease and benefit decrease. a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS using
DIFFERENT_PV_SIZES_ILLUSTRATES that the optimal waiting time for
SUBSTANTIAL_PV_DIFFUSION to smaller PV_SYSTEMS is longer than that of
larger systems. the paper also investigates the expected INVESTMENT_TIMES
in the UNITED_STATES, GERMANY, JAPAN, and KOREA and shows that all
countries except GERMANY_NEED to wait to invest. moreover, a
COMPARISON_STUDY to the net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) METHOD_DEMONSTRATES that
PV_SYSTEM_INVESTMENT can be additionally delayed by 5.7611.01 YEARS.

Title: a comparison of the REGIONAL_INVESTMENT_BENEFITS of CCS_RETROFITTING of
COAL fired POWER_PLANTS and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS in CHINA
Abstract:
```
CARBON_DIOXIDE (co2) capture and storage (ccs) TECHNOLOGY and
RENEWABLE_POWER are indispensable in CHINA's power sector to limit
GLOBAL_WARMING to 2c. because the two technologies have their OWN_MERITS
and weaknesses, it is important to understand their INVESTMENT_BENEFITS
and choose a cost_effective portfolio. therefore, we conducted an
INVESTMENT_EVALUATION of CCS_RETROFITTING of coal_fired POWER_PLANTS
(cfpp) with HYPOTHETICAL_SUBSIDIES and
RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS (rpp) by using a
REAL_OPTION_TRINOMIAL_TREE PRICING model and compared their
ECONOMIC_BENEFITS in DIFFERENT_PROVINCES in CHINA. the results showed
that when subsidies for the DESULFURIZATION_PRICE or the feed_in tariff
of WIND_POWER were adopted, the CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp did not achieve
the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_VALUE, even in 2027. if the decarbonized
ELECTRICITY_PRICE_INCREASES to 0.75 cny/kwh, equal to the feed_in tariff
of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC and BIOMASS_POWER, the CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp
would be commercially viable, and their INVESTMENT_VALUE would exceed
that of WIND POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS. in this situation, ningxia,
xinjiang, and GANSU_PROVINCES would be most suitable for the development
of CCS_RETROFITTING PILOT_PROJECTS; the advantages of the
CCS_RETROFITTING of cfpp were not significant, WHEREAS_RPP was a better
INVESTMENT_CHOICE in many provinces. this paper provides a perspective on
feed_in tariffs for POLICY_MAKERS to use in formulating a SUBSIDY_SYSTEM
to support the development of ccs in CHINA, with POLICY_IMPLICATIONS for
other countries.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY for SOLAR_PV_INTEGRATION in
RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS: a CASE_STUDY in the PHILIPPINES
Abstract:
```
in DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, particularly in RURAL_AREAS, LONG_PERIODS of
POWER_OUTAGES are experienced as the ELECTRICITY_GRID is technically or
economically unfeasible. as SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) is the most potential
and SUITABLE_SOURCE of RENEWABLE_ENERGY for these areas, this
PAPER_ANALYZES the ECONOMIC_VIABILITY of its INTEGRATION in
DIFFERENT_TYPES of RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS. applying REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH
under UNCERTAINTY in ELECTRICITY_PRICES, this STUDY_COMPARES the
attractiveness of adopting SOLAR_PV over continuing ELECTRICITY from the
grid focusing on VARIOUS_INVESTMENT_PAYMENT_SCHEMES including (i)
FULL_PAYMENT, (ii) distributed payment for 5 or 10 YEARS without a down
payment, and (iii) distributed payment for 5 or 10 YEARS with 20% or 40%
down payment. applying the model with the case of the PHILIPPINES, the
results with the FULL_PAYMENT_STRATEGY obtain OPTION_VALUES of usd 6888
for building type_i, usd 15349 for building type_ii, usd 21204 for
building type_iii, usd 27870 for building type_iv, and usd 34251 for
building type_v. these OPTION_VALUES_INCREASE by 21.6% and 22.5% with
distributed PAYMENT_SCHEME to a 5_or 10_year period and increase by 5%
and 13% for distributed payment with 40% and 20% down payment. these
OPTION_VALUES decrease with INVESTMENTS at later periods. contrary to the
CONVENTIONAL_OPTION_VALUATION_RESULTS of an OPTIMAL_DECISION to wait, our
findings show the otherwise as earlier INVESTMENT_REDUCES the RISK of
OPPORTUNITY_LOSS from delaying the adoption of SOLAR_PV. among the
PAYMENT_SCHEMES analyzed, the distribution of PV_SYSTEM_COST in a 10_year
installment period without down PAYMENT_SHOWS to be the most
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY which may encourage lower_income and
risk_averse consumers whose decision to adopt SOLAR_PV is affected by
COST_BARRIERS, ECONOMIC_STATUS, and HOUSEHOLD_INCOME. the STUDY_SUGGESTS
the GOVERNMENT, particularly in DEVELOPING_COUNTRIES, to support the
INTEGRATION of own_use SOLAR_PV in BUILDINGS through incentives and
subsidies, as well as FINANCIAL_INSTITUTIONS to offer more
AFFORDABLE_TERMS of payment that encourages low to
MEDIUM_INCOME_HOUSEHOLDS to adopt SOLAR_PV. further, this will not only
augment the ENERGY_DEFICIENCY in these countries but also support the
GLOBAL_ASPIRATIONS of reducing GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS and its
ADVERSE_EFFECTS through gradually shifting to RENEWABLE_SOURCES of

Title: the paradox effects of UNCERTAINTY and FLEXIBILITY on INVESTMENT in
RENEWABLES under GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT
Abstract:
```
given that companies have the FLEXIBILITY to decide about size and timing
of a RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY_INVESTMENT, the existence of four paradox
effects is proven: only the type but not the amount of
GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT has an influence on the OPTIMAL_CAPACITY of a
RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY GENERATING_SYSTEM. a decrease of
GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT over time may result in higher capacities of
RENEWABLES installed on an INDUSTRY_LEVEL, at least on the SHORT_TERM.
likewise, higher UNCERTAINTY may encourage an expansion of these
capacities. in contrast, TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS may hamper the expansion
of capacities. finally, these four paradox effects are exemplified in a
germany_based CASE_STUDY regarding a PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECT.  2016 elsevier

Abstract:
```
as INVESTMENT in RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS is increasing at a
RAPID_PACE, it is important to investigate whether delaying or otherwise
timing these INVESTMENTS can maximize LONG_TERM_INVESTMENT_GAINS.
CONVENTIONAL_FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS_METHODS for evaluating
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS in solar_electric system are all based on a one_time
installation of the PV_SYSTEMS and cannot be applied to analyze the
benefit of delayed and staged INVESTMENT. SUCH_BENEFITS could be
declining COSTS of PV_SYSTEMS thus tempting investors to hold off and
wait for a better moment to invest. this paper proposes a
DECISION_MAKING_FRAMEWORK using the REAL_OPTION_METHOD to analyze the
OPTIMUM_TIME to invest in a RESIDENTIAL_PV_SYSTEM in DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS.
a reference RESIDENTIAL_HOUSE is used to test the effect of
DIFFERENT_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES. the results show the type of staged
INVESTMENT of installing RESIDENTIAL_PV_SYSTEM that maximizes the
long_term payoff. this reveals when the option to DELAY_INVESTMENT is

Abstract:
```
this PAPER_APPLIES the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD to analyse the
DEFER_OPTION_VALUE and OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING for
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS in CHINA. the MAIN_PURPOSE of this paper is
to examine INVESTMENT_BEHAVIOURS under DIFFERENT_MARKET_SYSTEMS and
SUPPORT_SCHEMES. this paper further investigates the interaction of
TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and SUPPORT_SCHEMES. four scenarios are designed,
and the CORRESPONDING_REAL_OPTIONS_MODELS are established. in the
CASE_STUDY, we find that ELECTRICITY_MARKET_REFORM_ENHANCES the
DEFER_OPTION_VALUE in the SHORT_TERM but makes the owners of
SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS_POSTPONE their INVESTMENT. nevertheless, the GOVERNMENT
can STIMULATE_INVESTMENT by implementing APPROPRIATE_SUPPORT_SCHEMES.
additionally, the impacts of DIFFERENT_SUPPORT_SCHEMES vary according to
the MARKET_SYSTEM. the impacts of feed_in tariffs and PRICE_PREMIUMS are
similar in a regulated MARKET but are different in a FREE_MARKET. the
PRICE_PREMIUM_SCHEME greatly promotes the DEFER_OPTION_VALUES in the
SHORT_TERM, but the feed_in tariff scheme excels in the LONG_TERM. a
feed_in tariff has a greater impact on reducing the expected
EXECUTION_TIME and its variance than the PRICE_PREMIUM. in addition, more

Title: no REAL_OPTION for SOLAR in IRELAND: a REAL_OPTION_VALUATION of
UTILITY_SCALE_SOLAR_INVESTMENT in IRELAND
Abstract:
```
the IRISH_GOVERNMENT recently unveiled plans to have 70% of ELECTRICITY
in the state generated from RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES by 2030. currently
very little ELECTRICITY is generated by SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC in IRELAND. in
this study, a REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK is applied to assess the
ECONOMIC_FEASIBILITY of utility_scale SOLAR in IRELAND. initially,
ELECTRICITY_PRICES are identified as the MAIN_SOURCE of UNCERTAINTY and
the least SQUARE_MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is used to price the REAL_OPTION. the
findings are that, in the absence of COMPREHENSIVE_POLICY_SUPPORT,
large_scale INVESTMENT in SOLAR in IRELAND is not commercially viable and
that, where the REAL_OPTION has value, the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY is to
DEFER_INVESTMENT. SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS_SHOWS that the results are robust
and the analysis allows investors to make an informed bid to the newly
introduced RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY_SUPPORT_SCHEME (ress). when
POLICY_SUPPORT is introduced, a LARGE_REAL_OPTION_VALUE is obtained, and
UTILITY_SCALE_SOLAR_INVESTMENT is profitable. the implications are that
solar_specific policy supports may work better than policies that include
all RENEWABLE_TECHNOLOGIES because the dominance of onshore WIND_ENERGY
in IRELAND may price other RENEWABLE_SOURCES out.  2021

the impact of the CARBON_EMISSION trading MARKET,
AUXILIARY_SERVICE_MARKET, and DIFFERENT_ESS_INCENTIVE_POLICIES and their
SYNERGISTIC_ACTIONS on pv_ess INVESTMENT have been explored by
considering the SOCIAL_WELFARE of all related stakeholders. moreover, a
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS on the scale of expanding the INVESTMENT and
INCENTIVE_INTENSITY for ess is conducted. the results show that the
ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY is more favorable for investing in the pv_ess
project. the INVESTMENT will be brought forward 2 YEARS compared to the
situation without INCENTIVE_POLICY. in addition, from the perspective of
SOCIAL_WELFARE, the effects of the combinations of three
ESS_INCENTIVE_POLICIES are better than any single ESS_POLICY, and the
PROJECT_VALUE and SOCIAL_WELFARE_INCREASES by at least 3.46 and 7.99

Title: multi stage compound REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION in residential PV battery
INVESTMENT
Abstract:
```
STRATEGIC_VALUATION of efficient and well_timed NETWORK_INVESTMENTS under
UNCERTAIN_ELECTRICITY_MARKET_ENVIRONMENT has become increasingly
challenging, because there generally exist multiple interacting options
in these INVESTMENTS, and failing to systematically consider these
options can lead to decisions that undervalue the INVESTMENT. in our
work, a REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION (ROV) framework is proposed to determine
the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY for executing multiple interacting options within a
DISTRIBUTION_NETWORK_INVESTMENT, to mitigate the RISK of FINANCIAL_LOSSES
in the presence of FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES. to demonstrate the
characteristics of the proposed framework, we determine the
OPTIMAL_STRATEGY to economically justify the INVESTMENT in residential
pv_battery systems for ADDITIONAL_GRID supply during PEAK_DEMAND_PERIODS.
the options to defer, and then expand, are considered as multi_stage
COMPOUND_OPTIONS, since the option to expand is a SUBSEQUENT_OPTION of
the former. these options are valued via the least
SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO_METHOD, incorporating UNCERTAINTY over growing
POWER_DEMAND, varying DIESEL_FUEL_PRICE, and the declining COST of
pv_battery TECHNOLOGY as RANDOM_VARIABLES. finally, a
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS is performed to demonstrate how the proposed
FRAMEWORK_RESPONDS to UNCERTAIN_EVENTS. the proposed FRAMEWORK_SHOWS that

Title: is it a GOOD_TIME to develop COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS on FARMLAND?
an american style option with CROP_PRICE_RISK
Abstract:
```
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS require LARGE_SWATHS of land that are currently
being used for other purposes, such as farming. one option for developing
LARGE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS is converting FARMS that are currently
economically unviable into COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. however, this
may not always be an economically RATIONAL_DECISION as CROP_PRICES have
the potential to increase over time. fluctuations in FARM_INCOME due to
changes in CROP_PRICES can alter the OPTIMAL_CHOICE of whether to
continue farming or to convert FARMLAND into
COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS. this STUDY_ATTEMPTS to resolve this
issue by proposing a REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK to VALUE_FARM_PRODUCTION when
CROP_PRICES are uncertain. by integrating UNCERTAINTY into the
decision_making process, the value of keeping UNPROFITABLE_FARMS
operating prior to developing the area into a
COMMERCIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM is assessed. this helps DECISION_MAKERS
understand the extent to which POTENTIAL_INCOME from developing a
PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM should be greater than POTENTIAL_INCOME from farming
when deciding on investing in a PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEM. a CASE_STUDY is

Title: ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_REGULATION in france: a CASE_STUDY
for PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS based on REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
in this work, a NOVEL_METHODOLOGY based on the REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY has
been developed for the EVALUATION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_PROJECTS with a
capacity greater than 100 kw in france. FRENCH_LEGISLATION that regulates
these types of projects presents two REAL_OPTIONS: on the one hand, the
producer has a put option that consists of choosing between a feed_in
tariff system and ELECTRICITY_MARKET_SALE_PRICES every year, and this put
OPTION_COINCIDES with PUBLIC_SUBSIDIES granted by the
FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION. on the other hand, the FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION has a
CALL_OPTION that provides a benefit to the PUBLIC_SECTOR. this
OPTION_SUPPOSES a limit on the subsidized PRODUCTION of ELECTRICITY and
reduces the value of the project to the promoter. the value of the put
option is 4.28  per mwh generated. the extended net PRESENT_VALUE has a
value of 5.26 million euros. the BREAKEVEN_POINT of the project is
achieved with an increase of 59% in the regulated rate. this means that
the FRENCH_ADMINISTRATION must increase the value of PUBLIC_SUBSIDIES if
it wants to develop large_scale projects.  2020 by the author.

Title: valuing INVESTMENTS in domestic PV BATTERY_SYSTEMS under UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES are expected to play a MAJOR_ROLE in
mitigating CLIMATE_CHANGE and RESOURCE_DEPLETION effects as well as in
contributing to DOMESTIC_ENERGY_SECURITY. due to the INTERMITTENT_NATURE
of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV), there are often SIGNIFICANT_GAPS between
ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and ENERGY supply by PV_PLANTS. this makes
STORAGE_SYSTEMS a POTENTIAL_OPTION to MAXIMIZE_SAVINGS and
ACCRUE_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY by increasing the share of self_consumed
ENERGY while guaranteeing ADEQUATE_POWER_LEVELS in DISTRIBUTION_GRIDS.
this paper provides a THEORETICAL_FRAMEWORK to MODEL_HOUSEHOLDS_DECISION
to invest in DOMESTIC_PV_PLANTS coupled with BATTERY_STORAGE. to capture
the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY relative to the decision to install
both a PV_PLANT and a battery, i.e., a domestic pv_battery system (pvb),
we implement a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH and propose an OPTIMIZATION_MODEL,
which we calibrate and test according to data from the
ITALIAN_ENERGY_MARKET. our findings show that the option of storing
ENERGY via BATTERIES_INCREASES de facto INVESTMENT_VALUE: the adoption of
a PVB_INCREASES_MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, as HOUSEHOLDS can optimally
exercise the option to decide their consumption and
STORAGE_PATTERNS_CONTINGENT on FAVORABLE_MARKET_CONDITIONS. the
opportunity to STORE_ENERGY via BATTERIES_ENCOURAGES_HOUSEHOLDS to invest
in larger plants compared to those not paired with BATTERIES. there is
indeed a POSITIVE_RELATIONSHIP between the PVB_OPTIMAL_SIZE and
INVESTMENT_TIMING.  2021 elsevier b.v.

Title: impact of FLEXIBILITY in PUBLIC_R&d FUNDING: how REAL_OPTIONS could avoid
the CROWDING_OUT effect
Abstract:
```
this PAPER_EXPLORES NEW_MECHANISMS to ENSURE_GRANTS are additional to
PRIVATE_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT with no displacing or
crowding_out effect. our results indicate that by studying the
FLEXIBILITY embedded in these type of projects, using the
REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK, it is possible to reduce the size of grants given
by FINANCING bodies while remaining equally attractive to companies. this
result is reached due to the higher FLEXIBILITY provided in potential
NEW_GRANT_SCHEMES. in addition to the OBVIOUS_CONSEQUENCE of less
EXPENSIVE_PUBLIC_R&d FUNDING, there are other SIDE_BENEFITS to this
NEW_SCHEME, such as avoiding the crowding_out effect while also allowing
more honest and SINCERE_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT by companies
because they are sharing the RISK with the FUNDING body. this paper
presents a CASE_STUDY _ an r&D_PROJECT carried out in the concentrated
SOLAR_POWER_SECTOR _ in which we propose and calculate the effect of
providing the grant 2 YEARS earlier with a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS performed
over the DISCOUNT_RATE, VOLATILITY and first COMMERCIAL_REVENUE. this
paper may encourage FUNDING bodies to consider implementing
ALTERNATIVE_GRANT_SCHEMES valuing the FLEXIBILITY embedded in

Title: ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS of ELECTRICITY_STORAGE based on HEAT_PUMPS and
THERMAL_STORAGE_UNITS in LARGE_SCALE thermal POWER_PLANTS
Abstract:
```
in this paper the FINANCIAL_VIABILITY of a NOVEL_STORAGE_CONCEPT,
referred to as 'integrated pumped_heat_electricity storage', is assessed
for both a coal_fired and a combined cycle (cc) POWER_PLANT located in
GERMANY, as well as for a concentrated SOLAR_POWER (csp) plant located in
spain. the rationale of this concept is to use ELECTRICITY during times
of CHEAP_WHOLESALE_MARKET_PRICES, e.g. stemming from a high supply of
RENEWABLE_ENERGIES, in order to GENERATE_THERMAL_ENERGY via a HEAT_PUMP,
since THERMAL_ENERGY can be stored at comparatively low COST. if the
ELECTRICITY_DEMAND_RISES again, the stored THERMAL_ENERGY is used to
power a conventional water_steam cycle, thereby reducing the amount of
FOSSIL_FUELS used or enlarging the operating time of a CSP_PLANT. a mixed
INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAM, considering the day_ahead
WHOLESALE_MARKET_ELECTRICITY_PRICES and remunerations of
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER in GERMANY, is employed to find an
approximation of the OPTIMAL_SCHEDULE for the generation in the
POWER_PLANT as well as for the purchase and the sale of ELECTRICITY. the
FINANCIAL_VIABILITY is assessed using net PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) and
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS. storing ELECTRICITY to profit from
TEMPORAL_ARBITRAGE is found to be unprofitable, since the (conservatively
estimated) COSTS of THERMAL_STORAGE_UNITS are still too high. the largest
part of the revenues stems from the remunerations of
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER. therefore, while the utilization of
HEAT_PUMPS, which are estimated to have rather HIGH_COSTS, is not
profitable, employing ELECTRIC_HEATERS without STORAGE_UNITS is found to
be economically viable for a coal_fired and a CC_POWER_PLANT in GERMANY.
here, NPV and REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS_YIELD the same result, i.e. to invest
immediately in such an application. in spain,
OFFERING_TERTIARY_CONTROL_POWER is presently not remunerated, but only
the call_offs of TERTIARY_CONTROL_ENERGY, which are not considered in the
mixed INTEGER_LINEAR_PROGRAM. consequently, employing ELECTRIC_HEATERS in
CSP_PLANTS in spain is found to be not financially viable either.  2017

Title: do SMART_GRID_INNOVATIONS affect REAL_ESTATE_MARKET_VALUES?
Abstract:
```
to DATE_PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY_SYSTEMS have been widely installed on homes
in europe and all over the world. in europe and in ITALY INVESTMENTS in
DOMESTIC_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS (PV) were boosted by generous feed_in
tariffs that made these INVESTMENTS extremely attractive for
SMALL_PRIVATE_INVESTORS, such as homeowners. it is commonly agreed that
the greater the building ENERGY_EFFICIENCY, the greater the
PROPERTY_MARKET_VALUE. it is of PARAMOUNT_IMPORTANCE to determine the
value that PV_SYSTEMS may add to HOME_SALE_TRANSACTIONS. the aim of the
paper is to investigate whether SMART_GRIDS (sgs) INNOVATION can increase
MARKET_VALUES due to higher PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_FLEXIBILITY. sgs
give de facto producers and consumers, the opportunity to be active in
the ENERGY_MARKET and strategically decide their optimal
PRODUCTION/consumption pattern. in this paper, we provide a model based
on the REAL_OPTION_THEORY to determine the value of this FLEXIBILITY and
the related MARKET_VALUE_INCREASE. we model the HOMEOWNER_DECISION to
invest in a SOLAR_HOME with a PV_PLANT and connect to an sg by comparison
to the decision to invest in a SOLAR_HOME not connected to an sg. we
determine the PROPERTY_POTENTIAL_MARKET_VALUE_INCREASE due to the
opportunity to perform ACTIVE_ENERGY_MANAGEMENT given by SMART_GRIDS and
we compare this VALUE_INCREASE to the PV_PLANT_VALUE per se. to capture
the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY we implement a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH.
results of simulations, performed according to ZONAL_PRICES' trend and
VOLATILITY in the north and south of ITALY, show that in the north and in
the south, being connected to an SG_INCREASES by about 5_10% the
PV_INVESTMENT's value and this QUOTA_INCREASES as ENERGY_SAVINGS and
FLEXIBILITY_INCREASE. the greater the FLEXIBILITY, the greater the
PROPERTY_MARKET_VALUE.  2019 the author(s), LICENSEE_AIMS_PRESS.

Title: the determination of CONCESSION_PERIOD for BUILD_OPERATE_TRANSFER
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER_PROJECT under POLICY_INCENTIVES: a CASE_STUDY of
CHINA
Abstract:
```
since the CONCESSION_PERIOD is one of the most CRUCIAL_VARIABLES
influencing the success of a PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_PROJECT under
build_operate_transfer (bot) mode, this paper presents a
REAL_OPTION_GAME_MODELWHICH_INTEGRATES the REAL_OPTION and
COOPERATIVE_GAME_THEORYTO determine the OPTIMAL_CONCESSION_PERIOD of the
BOT_SOLAR_PV_POWER_PROJECT under POLICY_INCENTIVES by considering the
value of the option to defer. in the proposed model, an
EFFECTIVE_INTERVAL of CONCESSION_PERIOD for the BOT_PROJECT was
identified by using a REAL_OPTION, and the EQUILIBRIUM_VALUE of the
CONCESSION_PERIOD was obtained by applying CLASSICAL_OPTIMIZATION_THEORY.
to evaluate our model, we empirically determined the
OPTIMAL_CONCESSION_PERIOD for the BOT_SOLAR_PV_POWER_PROJECT in CHINA,
and a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS was conducted to demonstrate how
RELEVANT_INFLUENTIAL_FACTORS, which are presented in the model, affect
the EQUILIBRIUM_VALUE of the CONCESSION_PERIOD and its
EFFECTIVE_INTERVAL. the results indicate that the
CURRENT_INVESTMENT_ENVIRONMENT in CHINA could successfully implement the
BOT_SOLAR_PV_POWER_PROJECT under POLICY_INCENTIVES, including
INITIAL_COST_SUBSIDY and the feed_in tariffs mechanism. while the
HIGH_VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY_DEMAND, INVESTMENT_COST, and land_use rent
fee can lead the failure of the BOT_SOLAR_PV_PROJECT_IMPLEMENTATION,
promoting the TECHNOLOGICAL_DEVELOPMENT of PV_POWER_GENERATION,
maintaining the MARKET_STABILITY, and increasing the POLICY_INCENTIVES
can help the BOT_POWER_PROJECT to be arranged with an
OPTIMAL_CONCESSION_PERIOD. in addition, the feed_in tariffs mechanism is
more helpful than the INITIAL_COST_SUBSIDY for winning the BOT_CONTRACT.

Title: price and SUBSIDY under UNCERTAINTY: REAL_OPTION_APPROACH to
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS on ENERGY_STORAGE with SOLAR_PV
Abstract:
```
RENEWABLE_GENERATION_SOURCES still have not achieved ECONOMIC_VALIDITY in
many countries including KOREA, and require subsidies to support the
transition to a low_carbon economy. an initial feed_in tariff (fit) was
adopted to support the deployment of RENEWABLE_ENERGY in KOREA until 2011
and then was switched to the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard (rps) to
implement more market_oriented MECHANISMS. however, HIGH_VOLATILITIES in
ELECTRICITY_PRICES and subsidies under the RPS_SCHEME have weakened
INVESTMENT_INCENTIVES. in this study we estimate how the
MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES under the RPS_SCHEME affect the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS of ENERGY_STORAGE_PROJECTS, whose importance
is increasing rapidly because they can mitigate the variability and
UNCERTAINTY of SOLAR and WIND generation in the POWER_SYSTEM. we applied
MATHEMATICAL_ANALYSIS based on real_option methods to estimate the
OPTIMAL_TRIGGER_PRICE for INVESTMENT in energy_storage projects with and
without MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES. we found that the
OPTIMAL_TRIGGER_PRICE of SUBSIDY called the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATE
(rec) under MULTIPLE_PRICE_VOLATILITIES is 10.5% higher than that under
no PRICE_VOLATILITIES. if the VOLATILITY of the REC_PRICE gets doubled,
the project requires a 26.6% higher OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PRICE to justify
the INVESTMENT against the increased RISK. in the end, we propose an
AUCTION_SCHEME that has the advantage of both rps and fit in order to
minimize the FINANCIAL_BURDEN of the SUBSIDY_PROGRAM by eliminating
SUBSIDY_VOLATILITY and find the minimum willingness_to_accept price for
investors.  the author(s) 2021.

grid_scale ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS} (ess) have been widely recognized as a
technically VIABLE_ALTERNATIVE to NETWORK_AUGMENTATION in integrating
growing RENEWABLE_PENETRATION in DISTRIBUTION_NETWORKS. however, it is
challenging to determine efficient and well_timed INVESTMENT in the

within this context, we develop a methodology that explicitly (i)
INCORPORATES_ESS_SCHEDULES within MONTE_CARLO_POWER_FLOW_SIMULATIONS, and
(ii) determine the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY using
REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION (ROV). specifically, we develop a mixed
INTEGER_QUADRATIC programming to determine the OPTIMAL_SIZE and schedules
of a grid_scale ess in an AUSTRALIAN_DISTRIBUTION_NETWORK. the benefits
from BATTERY_OPERATIONS to the network are quantitatively incorporated in
the ROV to capture the value of MANAGERIAL_FLEXIBILITY, and hence the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY. driven by the declining BATTERY_COST, the
results suggest to delay the INVESTMENT to a later year to maximize the

Abstract:

MICROGRIDS can integrate the PRODUCTION and CONSUMPTION_PROCESS of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY and realize the SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT of

WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_MICROGRIDS due to
HIGH_COSTS. this study develops a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for it to assess
peak_valley ELECTRICITY_PRICES and ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES under the
uncertainties in the INITIAL_INVESTMENT dynamic. the ADJUSTMENT_MECHANISM
is also established in the REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL to analyze the tendency of
INCENTIVE_POLICIES changing with UNCERTAINTY. the results demonstrate
that the OPTIMAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES of 31 provinces in
CHINA_RANGE from 0.30 rmb/kwh to 1.05 rmb/kwh, and the OPTIMAL_RATES of
peak_valley price range from 3.09 to 6.32. on this basis, we conduct a
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS of OPTIMAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY and peak_valley
price rate and find that the threshold goes down significantly as the
COST goes down. however, RAPID_COST_VARIATIONS and fluctuations make
DEVELOPERS_HESITATE to invest, which will seriously hinder the
WIDESPREAD_COMMERCIAL_ADOPTION of PV_MICROGRIDS. this study extends the
understanding of participants' strategies in a DYNAMIC_FRAMEWORK by
analyzing the impacts of UNCERTAINTY on INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. we suggest
developers pay attention to the changes in the MARKET and reduce
INVESTMENT_RISKS by signing OPTION_CONTRACTS. a
STABLE_INVESTMENT_MARKET_CORRESPONDS to smaller peak_valley price rates
and less ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES. the policy_maker should provide
flexible and EFFICIENT_INCENTIVES depending on the APPLICATION_SCENARIO.
it is also suggested that in areas lacking SOLAR_RESOURCES, the
GOVERNMENT should not only speed up the establishment of peak_valley
ELECTRICITY_PRICES but also provide long_term subsidies.  2022

the process of evaluating INVESTMENTS by ELECTRICITY_UTILITIES to

POWER_FLOW_ANALYSIS that INCORPORATES_BATTERY_SCHEDULING_PROFILES.
specifically, the ROV_FRAMEWORK_SOLVES_STOCHASTIC_POWER_FLOW_ANALYSIS
with BATTERY_SCHEDULING in a forward_looking MC_MODEL, and determines the

using BACKWARD_INDUCTION over all MC_PATHS. however, this approach to mc
becomes computationally prohibitive when BATTERY_OPERATIONAL_PROFILES are
generated by optimization_based home ENERGY_MANAGEMENT. to reduce the
COMPUTATIONAL_BURDEN, we use POLICY_FUNCTION_APPROXIMATION to provide
FAST_BATTERY_OPERATIONAL_PROFILES, drawing on MACHINE_LEARNING_METHODS
that reduce MC_COMPUTATION_TIME by 95%. compared to

Abstract:
```
as the transition to WIND and SOLAR_PROGRESSES, the INTEGRATION of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES makes ELECTRICITY_PRODUCTION increasingly
fluctuating, also causing VOLATILITY in ELECTRICITY_PRICES on
ENERGY_MARKETS. in order to guarantee POWER_GRID_STABILITY,
UTILITIES_NEED to BALANCE_VOLATILE supply through shifting demand. this
measure of DEMAND_SIDE_MANAGEMENT_CREATES_FLEXIBILITY, being enabled as
the INTEGRATION of information and COMMUNICATION_TECHNOLOGY, e.g.
SMART_METERS and LOAD_CONTROL_SWITCHES, in the POWER_GRID grows. the
FLEXIBILITY of deferring consumption to times of lower demand or higher
supply bears an ECONOMIC_VALUE which can be quantified by recurring to
ELECTRICITY_MARKET_PRICES. our KERNEL_THEORY in terms of
DESIGN_SCIENCE_RESEARCH, REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY is the APPROPRIATE_APPROACH
for quantification under UNCERTAINTY. it provides for the assessment of
INVESTMENT_POTENTIAL in INFORMATION_SYSTEMS for LOAD_CONTROL. addressing
the prerequisite, we develop a STOCHASTIC_PROCESS which realistically

SINGAPORE: perspective of CONSUMERS_BEHAVIOUR
Abstract:
```
RESIDENTIAL_PHOTOVOLTAIC (rpv) is designed for RESIDENTIAL_BUILDINGS to
GENERATE_ELECTRICITY from SOLAR_ENERGY. despite
VARIOUS_GOVERNMENT_REGULATIONS to boost PV_DEPLOYMENT, RPV_DIFFUSION in
SINGAPORE has been slow, accounting for less than 4% of installed
PV_CAPACITY by 2021. INVESTMENT_VOLATILITY and
UNCERTAINTY_IMPEDE_RPV_DEPLOYMENT as it significantly AFFECTS_CONSUMERS'
ADOPTION_DECISIONS. RPV_DIFFUSION_ANALYSIS helps researchers develop
DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGIES by considering and modelling the
RPV_DIFFUSION_PROCESS and its major influencing factors. however, the
existing WORKS_NEGLECT_HETEROGENOUS_CONSUMERS' behaviours to
ADDRESS_INVESTMENT_VOLATILITY in the network. CONSUMER_BEHAVIOURS,
including SPONTANEOUS_ADOPTION_DECISIONS and
INTERPERSONAL_COMMUNICATIONS, are essential in determining RPV_ADOPTION
and DIFFUSION. this study constructed a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS supported
agent_based DIFFUSION_MODEL (roa_abdm) to investigate the RPV_DIFFUSION
in SINGAPORE by applying the bottom_up SIMULATION modelling approach. ROA
is used in SIMULATION based RPV_DIFFUSION_ANALYSIS to offer consumers
FLEXIBLE_OPTIONS to ADDRESS_INVESTMENT_VOLATILITY by calculating the
option's value. afterward, the agent_based DIFFUSION_MODEL is developed,
calibrated, and validated with rpv HISTORICAL_DIFFUSION_DATA in
SINGAPORE. from the what_if analysis using the developed model, this
STUDY_IDENTIFIES that the OPTIMAL_RPV_SUBSIDY_INTENSITY is 3040% and
reveals that RPV_DIFFUSION is more effective in a tight_knit network and
sensitive to INVESTMENT_VOLATILITY. based on the findings, this study
proposes two POLICY_SUGGESTIONS, including stage_based DYNAMIC_POLICY and
trusted_network oriented campaigns. this STUDY_CONTRIBUTES to the body of
knowledge by integrating ROA_ANALYSIS into agent_based modelling for the
RPV_DIFFUSION_ANALYSIS, and the proposed model can be extended to analyse
other RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in DIFFERENT_GEOGRAPHIC_REGIONS.

Title: techno economic framework for OPTIMAL_CAPACITY_EXPANSION of
ACTIVE_MICROGRID in the mediterranean: a CASE_STUDY of mcast
Abstract:
```
the purpose of MICROGRIDS is to improve SYSTEM_FLEXIBILITY and RESILIENCE
during normal and EMERGENCY_CONDITIONS. the
CEASELESS_LOAD_GROWTH_MANDATES to increase MICROGRID's capacity, thereby
improving the SYSTEM_FLEXIBILITY and RESILIENCE. however,
CAPACITY_EXPANSION requires SIGNIFICANT_INVESTMENTS, making it essential
to identify the OPTIMAL_CAPACITY of ENERGY_RESOURCES. the methodologies
proposed in the LITERATURE_IDENTIFIES the MICROGRID's capacity with an
assumption of INVESTMENTS with a single installment. this way of
THEORETICAL_APPROACH leads to UNREALISTIC_SOLUTIONS. besides, MICROGRID's
participation in a FLEXIBLE_MARKET will enhance its performance both in
commercial and TECHNICAL_ASPECTS. therefore, this paper proposes a
REALISTIC_FRAMEWORK with the concept 'expansion through time' inspired by
'REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY.' this framework includes PRACTICAL_PARAMETERS like
RESOURCE_LOAD_UNCERTAINTY, PHYSICAL_SPACE required to install, revenue
generated by resources, and MAXIMUM_DEMAND_PENALTY, on top of
ELECTRICAL_PARAMETERS; constrained with SIGNIFICANT_RETURN in INVESTMENTS
to improve the OVERALL_SAVINGS. in addition, this paper proposes a
MARKET_PARTICIPATION_MODEL for MICROGRID, which defines a bidding process
with two components, such as regular and FLEXIBLE_PORTIONS under both
normal and EXTREME_CONDITIONS. this STUDY_CONSIDERS renewable_based
ENERGY_RESOURCES like solar_photovoltaic plants (spps) and
BATTERY_ENERGY_STORAGE_SYSTEMS (besss) as MICROGRIDS' ENERGY_RESOURCES.
the system chosen for testing the efficacy of the proposed framework is a

Title: a compound REAL_OPTION_APPROACH for determining the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PATH for rpv STORAGE_SYSTEMS
Abstract:
```
the use of residential photovoltaic_storage systems may produce
LARGE_BENEFITS to owners and has expanded rapidly in RECENT_YEARS.
nonetheless, LARGE_UNCERTAINTIES regarding the PROFITABILITY of these
systems make it necessary to INCORPORATE_FLEXIBILITIES in their
ECONOMIC_EVALUATIONS. this paper offers a NEW_METHOD to evaluate the
COMPOUND_FLEXIBILITY of both the option of delaying INVESTMENTS and the
option of further expanding the capacity of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_MODULES
and BATTERIES during the INVESTMENT_HORIZON. FLEXIBILITY is modeled as a
compound REAL_OPTION, whose value is computed using a NOVEL_METHOD that
we call compound least SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO (clsm). the model is applied
to the INVESTMENT_DECISIONS associated to a residential
photovoltaic_storage system. results suggest that investors should use
the proposed CLSM_METHOD in the ECONOMIC_VALUATION of multi_stage
projects, since considering only a single FLEXIBILITY could promote
sub_optimal decisions. moreover, in our CASE_STUDY, we show that it is
optimal to break the INVESTMENT down into two steps or more in 36% of
FUTURE_SCENARIOS, on average.  copyright  2022 by the iaee. all rights

Title: SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_VALUATION with
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_TRINOMIAL_LATTICE REAL_OPTION_MODEL
Abstract:
```
under the uncertain and the FLEXIBILITY required conditions, the
CONVENTIONAL_CAPITAL budgeting techniques are insufficient to decide the
most FEASIBLE_INVESTMENT due to their STATIC_NATURE.
CLASSICAL_REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_TECHNIQUES have been used for
VARIOUS_INVESTMENT_OPTIONS such as deferment and abandonment. although
these techniques help to evaluate the projects in UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTS,
they still follow the static, CERTAIN_BOOLEAN_LOGIC_ASSUMPTIONS.
therefore, further improvement in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION has been
introduced with the usage of FUZZY_LOGIC. FUZZY_LOGIC is applied by
binomial and black_scholes REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_METHODS up to date, but
not with the TRINOMIAL_LATTICE. moreover, types_1 and 2 FUZZY_NUMBERS are
used; however, the INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS are not analyzed in
detail in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION. in this ARTICLE, we propose an
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_TRINOMIAL_LATTICE REAL_OPTION_VALUATION_MODEL for a
SOLAR_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PROJECT. while valuing the DEFERMENT_OPTION,
EXPERT_OPINIONS, two DIFFERENT_VOLATILITY_METHODS, and a tailor_made
ELECTRICITY price_forecasting model are used. according to our results,
the DEFERMENT_OPTION is valuable and delaying the start of the project
provides a much higher expanded net PRESENT_VALUE than an
IMMEDIATE_START. the contribution of this ARTICLE is that the UNCERTAINTY
in the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION is modeled from a BROADER_PERSPECTIVE with
INTUITIONISTIC_FUZZY_NUMBERS by taking the hesitancy of the
decision_maker and the MARKET into account. consequently, the proposed
method would increase the accuracy of the REAL_OPTION_VALUATION in
UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENTS such as RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SECTOR.   1988_2012 ieee.

Title: a STATISTICAL_LEARNING_APPROACH to determine optimal sizing &
INVESTMENT_TIMING of COMMERCIAL_SCALE distributed ENERGY_RESOURCES
Abstract:
```
the problem of optimal sizing and INVESTMENT_TIMING for a portfolio of
gas_fired and PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) generation is presented and solved using
an optimization_ CLASSIFICATION_TECHNIQUE. it is assumed that the demand,
the prices of NATURAL_GAS, and PV_TECHNOLOGY are STOCHASTIC_PROCESSES.
our methodology takes advantage of decomposing the problem into two
sub_problems. first, the optimal sizing problem is solved using
DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING and most LIKELY_SOLUTIONS are identified as clusters.
then, the INVESTMENT_TIME_PROBLEM is formulated as a REAL_OPTION for each
cluster to determine OPTIMAL_TIMING. although the two_step OPTIMIZATION
approach can successfully close the loop between OPERATIONAL_DYNAMICS and
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS, we are also interested in discovering patterns in a
MULTIDIMENSIONAL_SPACE of INPUT_PARAMETERS that make a
CERTAIN_COMBINATION of ASSETS_OPTIMAL among dozens of DISCRETE_CHOICES.
on that note, by applying RECURSIVE_PARTITIONING ALGORITHM,
DECISION_TREES are developed to estimate the structure of solutions
rendered from OPTIMIZATION_MODELS by a rule_based system. despite the
HIGH_LEVEL of accuracy, the INITIAL_MODEL is biased in favor of highly
FREQUENT_CLUSTERS, and discards the OPTIMAL_CLUSTERS resulted from
EXTREME_MARKET_BEHAVIORS. value at RISK (var) is employed as a
RISK_MEASURE to demonstrate the ENHANCEMENT_RISK_PERFORMANCE. finally, in
order to investigate the robustness of the results, we conduct
EXTENSIVE_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS over DIFFERENT_PARAMETER_SETTINGS. the
proposed model can be thought of as a statistically OPTIMAL_SUMMARIZER of
OPTIMIZATION_MODELS that enables DECISION_MAKERS to have an insight into
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES according to characteristics of the
building and the long_term ENERGY_MARKET outlook.  2020 ELSEVIER_LTD

Abstract:
```
CHINA's PHOTOVOLTAIC POVERTY_ALLEVIATION power stations (ppaps) properly
combine POVERTY_ALLEVIATION and RENEWABLE_POWER_GENERATION while also
meeting RURAL_ENERGY_DEMANDS. the FUNDAMENTAL_PROBLEM is how to optimize
the benefits of ppaps during its limited lifetime. using the
post_operation of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POVERTY_ALLEVIATION_POWER_PLANTS as a
starting point, this paper proposes a model combining REAL_OPTION_THEORY
and COOPERATIVE_GAME to determine the IDEAL_CONTRACT_PERIOD of service
committed by the GOVERNMENT to the operation and maintenance (o&m)
company, thus providing a reference for both parties. the model's
validity and applicability are verified by incorporating a ppaps from
HENAN_PROVINCE in CHINA as an example; ultimately, the factors
influencing the o&M_CONTRACT_PERIOD are ranked using the sobol
GLOBAL_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS. the results show that when the SOLAR
industry's environment is positive, the GOVERNMENT is more inclined to
sign long_term contracts with o&M_COMPANIES. in contrast, the more the
GOVERNMENT invests in the facilities, the more likely both parties will
sign short_term contracts. furthermore, the o&m company's
CAPITAL_INVESTMENT in the POWER_STATION has a DIRECT_IMPACT on the

Title: statistical decision theoretic RISK_MANAGEMENT for planning
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PATHWAYS
Abstract:
```
the world has witnessed an increase in the level of INVESTMENTS for
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in the PAST_DECADE mainly owing to the
pressure for mitigating GREENHOUSE_GAS (ghg) EMISSIONS, whilst addressing
the issue of CLIMATE_CHANGE. according to RECENT_STATISTICS,
GLOBAL_INVESTMENTS edged up by 2 % in 2019 to $301.7 billion, taking the
value of CUMULATIVE_INVESTMENTS since 2004 to $3.5 trillion, which has
been attributed to the falling COSTS of SOLAR and WIND technologies. with
the commissioning of ADDITIONAL_CAPACITIES from RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES
each year, there is a growing need for managing the associated
RISKS_AND_UNCERTAINTIES from the perspective of DIFFERENT_STAKEHOLDERS
throughout the planning, development and OPERATIONAL_PHASES.
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES entail CONSIDERABLE_TECHNOLOGICAL and
FINANCIAL_RISKS_EXPOSURE, depending on the location where the
technologies are implemented, and thus needs to be managed using
techniques that would provide both the quantification of RISKS and
OPTIMAL_DECISIONS that lead to RISK MITIGATION. the objective of the
proposed RESEARCH is to develop a PROBABILISTIC_FRAMEWORK which broadly
includes: (a) statistical modelling of FINANCIAL_RISKS _ such as
variability of revenue due to ELECTRICITY_PRICE, DEMAND_FLUCTUATIONS,
GENERATION_COSTS, or other MARKET_CONDITIONS; and (b) evaluating options
that maximise the stakeholders utility/reward functions, or
MINIMISE_RISKS, for a given TECHNOLOGY_MIX. this RESEARCH_DEMONSTRATES
the implementation of BINOMIAL_LATTICE_MODEL in REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
(ROA) for the VALUATION of INVESTMENTS on diversified ENERGY_PORTFOLIOS.
the framework is applied to analyse the impact of RISKS_AND_UNCERTAINTIES
on CAPITAL budgeting decisions relating to PROJECT_SIZE (expand or
contract); PROJECT_LIFE and timing (initiation, deferment or abandon);
and PROJECT_OPERATION (FLEXIBILITY in the TECHNOLOGY_MIX) for scenarios
involving large_scale deployment of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES.  2021

Title: rethinking the EVALUATION of SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECTS under

Abstract:

many CORPORATIONS_INVEST in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) projects to
MITIGATE_CLIMATE change. however, lack of CAPITAL_POSES a GREAT_CHALLENGE
to the development of the SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY. yieldcos that are a
FINANCIAL_TOOL to SECURITIZE_ASSESTS for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CORPORATIONS
were introduced to alleviate the FINANCIAL_PRESSURE, but their
achievements are unable to meet the expected PERFORMANCE_LEVEL.
therefore, a QUESTION_ARAISES: can yieldcos promote the development of
SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY? to solve this issue, this paper utilized a
REAL_OPTION_METHOD to investigate whether yieldcos can facilitate the
deployment of SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS and their impact on decision_making
processes. based on the solution obtained from the REAL_OPTION_MODEL, we
explore the impacts of DECISIVE_FACTORS on the DEFER_OPTION_VALUE,
INVESTMENT_THRESHOLD and expected EXECUTION_TIME. the JOINT_IMPACTS of
the DIVIDEND_RATIO and other factors are also investigated. we conclude
that yieldcos are suitable for SOLAR_PV_PROJECTS, while a
HIGH_DIVIDEND_RATIO will make INVESTORS_POSTPONE their INVESTMENTS. in
addition, by using the TECHNOLOGICAL_LEVEL to represent the DRIFT_TERM of
INVESTMENT, we further discuss how decision_makers should react to the
POTENTIAL_TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION. moreover, we also discuss the impacts
of potential declines in feed_in tariffs on INVESTORS_BEHAVIOUR. we
conclude that yieldcos can promote the development of SOLAR_PV in CHINA

Title: a REAL_OPTIONS based DECISION_MAKING model analysis for CLIMATE_CHANGE
MITIGATION_STRATEGIES on BUILDINGS
Abstract:
```
FLEXIBLE_OPTIONS are expected to be adopted in CLIMATE_CHANGE
MITIGATION_STRATEGIES due to the HIGH_UNCERTAINTY of CLIMATE_CHANGE.
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) matches the feature of filling FLEXIBILITY
under CLIMATE_CHANGE but is seldom leveraged in the decision_making of
STRATEGY_INVESTMENT at the building scale. this study proposes a
roa_based decision_making framework to bridge this RESEARCH_GAP. first,
the FUTURE_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION is simulated, and the expected yearly
FUTURE_ENERGY_LOSS caused by CLIMATE_CHANGE is calculated. then,
individual and SEQUENTIAL_INVESTMENT_ANALYSES are made based on ROA and
three strategies (i.e., shading, PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS, and shading +
PHOTOVOLTAIC_PANELS). finally, a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS for
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME, INVESTMENT_SEQUENCE, etc., is performed, and
REGRESSION_ANALYSIS is used to prove and extend the
SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS_RESULTS. the results show that CLIMATE_CHANGE
UNCERTAINTY does not alter the optimal individual and
SEQUENTIAL_INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES. however, increasing the
DISCOUNT_RATE_ADVANCES the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME and shows an
EXPONENTIAL_RELATIONSHIP with the premium. the enhancement of forcing has
a MARGINAL_EFFECT on PROJECT_RETURN and it advances the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_YEAR for INDIVIDUAL_INVESTMENT. additionally, the
forcing positively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option
under shared socioeconomic pathways ssp1_2.6 and ssp2_4.5 but it
negatively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option under
ssp3_7.0 and ssp5_8.5. the UNIT_DRY_BULB_TEMPERATURE under certain
forcing yields a range of benefits from 0.47  106 to 0.90  106 usd when
deferring the option. this proposed decision_making FRAMEWORK_GUIDES the
development of MITIGATION_STRATEGIES and provides more

Title: valuing PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANTS by compound REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
MEETING_ELECTRICITY_DEMAND with RENEWABLE_GENERATION requires spending
trillions of dollars in INVESTMENTS exposed to FINANCIAL_RISK.
RENEWABLE_PROJECTS have MULTIPLE_STRATEGIC_REAL_OPTIONS to
MANAGE_INVESTMENT_RISK, but they are usually priced separately in
isolation. this paper proposes a framework for valuing
MULTISTAGE_DECISIONS in a grid_scale PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_PLANT under
UNCERTAINTY. the project is modelled as a COMPOUND_PORTFOLIO of
AMERICAN_SEQUENTIAL and mutually EXCLUSIVE_OPTIONS to defer, expand and
relocate. the COMPOUND_OPTIONS are jointly priced by a hierarchically
nested least_squares MONTE_CARLO ALGORITHM. the
FRAMEWORK_INCORPORATES_UNCERTAINTIES related to decreasing COSTS in
SOLAR_TECHNOLOGY and the EMERGENCE of more PROFITABLE_RENEWABLE_TARIFFS
elsewhere. the results show that the value of the
COMPOUND_OPTION_PORTFOLIO significantly exceeds the value of the single
DEFERRAL_OPTION commonly considered in practice. ignoring expansion and
RELOCATION_FLEXIBILITIES may lead to underinvestment by mispricing the
value of PV_PROJECTS. incorporating these OPTIONS_ENCOURAGES
EARLY_COMMITMENT of the PV_INVESTMENT. moreover, summation of
INDIVIDUAL_OPTION_PRICES may not be a GOOD_APPROXIMATION of the
TRUE_PORTFOLIO_VALUE, as interactions among options exist. these findings
may improve ALLOCATION_EFFICIENCY of RENEWABLE_INVESTMENTS,

effect of including these SYSTEM_CHARACTERISTICS is illustrated with
NUMERICAL_EXAMPLES, where we find the CANNIBALIZATION_EFFECT to decrease
projected profit relative to INVESTMENT_COST from 33% to between 13% and

PV investing in an UNCERTAIN_ENVIRONMENT. the model is applied to
ANALYZE_PROJECTS in the east CHINA_POWER_GRID_REGION under multiple
self_consumption ratio scenarios. the results show that investing in
distributed PV_PROJECTS is beneficial, but there are differences in the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING under different self_consumption ratios.
investors can DEFER_INVESTMENT for as early as one year to obtain
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_VALUE.  2022 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: economic and FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS of a grid connected PV_SYSTEM in rio de
janeiro for residential and commercial supply
Abstract:
```
SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT and RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES are topics that have
attracted GLOBAL_ATTENTION together with greater awareness of the need to
preserve the planet's NATURAL_RESOURCES while still supplying
ENERGY_DEMAND. this paper presents an economic and FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS of
a PV grid_connected system for residential and commercial supply located
in the state of rio de janeiro. the model is evaluated considering
TECHNICAL_ASPECTS like ENERGY_SECURITY, compatibility,
ENERGY_PRODUCTION_OPTIMISATION and ECONOMIC_PAYBACK forecasting where the
REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY (rot) is applied for ECONOMIC_ANALYSIS. the
ECONOMIC_VIABILITY and the TECHNICAL_POTENTIAL of a grid_connected system
rated at 2.7 kwp and 11.7 KWP_PV for residential and COMMERCIAL_SCALE,
respectively, were examined. demonstrating that for a system expected to
last 25 YEARS, the PAYBACK_TIME_RESULTS occur in six YEARS, minimum, at
RESIDENTIAL_SCALE and five YEARS at COMMERCIAL_SCALE, proving the
INVESTMENT_VIABILITY. copyright  inderscience enterprises ltd.

Title: EVALUATION of INVESTMENT_STRATEGIES for rooftop distributed PV and
CCS_TECHNOLOGIES in CHINA under MULTIPLE_SCENARIOS
Abstract:
```
CCS_TECHNOLOGY is significant to achieve CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION in the
current coal_based ENERGY_MIX in CHINA, just as PV received more
POLICY_SUBSIDIES from the CHINESE_GOVERNMENT to promote its
INDUSTRY_DEVELOPMENT in the EARLY_STAGE, and all parties in the society,
including the GOVERNMENT and enterprises, have paid attention to and
supported the development of CCS_TECHNOLOGY to promote the implementation
of CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION. this PAPER_EVALUATES the
REGIONAL_INVESTMENT_BENEFITS and INVESTMENT_TIMING of CCS_RETROFITTING
and rtdpv in DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS for each province in CHINA based on the
REAL_OPTION_APPROACH. the results show that the INITIAL_COST_SUBSIDY and
participation in the CARBON_MARKET are not as effective as the feed_in
tariff SUBSIDY, and the INVESTMENT_RETURN of CCS_RETROFIT is better than
rtdpv in the scenario with feed_in tariff SUBSIDY, and most provinces can
achieve IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT. rtdpv without subsidies cannot achieve
FULL_PARITY nationwide yet, and some provinces are not suitable for
INVESTMENT without participating in the CARBON_MARKET. the net
PRESENT_VALUE_APPROACH would underestimate the INVESTMENT_VALUE of ccs
and rtdpv and prematurely REJECT_INVESTMENT in many scenarios, while
provinces under the REAL_OPTION_APPROACH tend to DELAY_INVESTMENT to
obtain OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_RETURNS. this paper provides a reference for
investors to make INVESTMENT_DECISIONS in low_carbon technologies and for
governments to develop CCS_INCENTIVES. copyright  2022 yang, cui, he and

Title: deriving FUTURE_BUILDING_STOCKS from home owners' REAL_OPTION to
DEFER_INVESTMENTS
Abstract:
```
PRIVATE_HOME_OWNERS are free to invest in ENERGY EFFICIENT_REFURBISHMENTS
of their building at any time. besides, they can
INSTALL_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SYSTEMS, HEAT_PUMPS and other EQUIPMENT at will.
although the consequences for DISTRIBUTION_GRIDS can be significant, most
studies about the FUTURE supply task still utilize fixed ANNUAL_RATES of
refurbishment and scenarios for the installation of distributed
ENERGY_RESOURCES (der). while highly ECONOMICAL_INVESTMENTS are usually
undertaken, a lot of UNCERTAINTY remains for PRIVATE_INVESTORS. in this
study, the effect of SUCH_UNCERTAINTIES is modelled in terms of a highly
FLEXIBLE_REAL_OPTIONS_VALUATION that focuses on the option to defer an
INVESTMENT. it is therefore assumed that the expected value of most
INVESTMENTS is high while a SIGNIFICANT_AMOUNT of RISK has to be dealt
with. HISTORIC_DATA of refurbishment and MARKET_SITUATION is used to
calibrate the model and to derive FUTURE_RATES of refurbishment for
DIFFERENT_SUBSIDY_SCHEMES.  2016 ieee.
