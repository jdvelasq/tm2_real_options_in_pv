Title: a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT with application to
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA
Abstract:
```
this paper proposes a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for evaluating
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT by considering UNCERTAIN_FACTORS such as
CO2_PRICE, non_renewable ENERGY COST, INVESTMENT_COST and MARKET_PRICE of
ELECTRICITY. a phase_out mechanism is built into the model to reflect the
long_term changes of SUBSIDY_POLICY. we apply the proposed model to
empirically evaluate the INVESTMENT_VALUE and OPTIMAL_TIMING for
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA. our EMPIRICAL_RESULTS show
that the CURRENT_INVESTMENT_ENVIRONMENT in CHINA may not be able to
attract IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT, while the development of CARBON_MARKET
helps advance the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME. a SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS is
conducted to investigate the dynamics of INVESTMENT_VALUE and
OPTIMAL_TIMING under the changes of unit generating capacity,
SUBSIDY_LEVEL, MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, CO2_PRICE and
INVESTMENT_COST. it is found that the HIGH_INVESTMENT_COST and the
VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY and CO2_PRICES, are not conducive to attract
IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT. instead, increasing the level of SUBSIDY, promoting
TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and maintaining the stability of MARKET are useful
to STIMULATE_INVESTMENT.  2016 elsevier b.v.

Title: optimal FEED_IN_TARIFF for SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA:
a REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
Abstract:
```
the feed_in tariff policy is widely used to promote the development of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY. CHINA also adopts feed_in tariff policy to attract
greater INVESTMENT in SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION. this study
employs REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD to assess the OPTIMAL_LEVELS of feed_in
tariffs in 30 provinces of CHINA. the uncertainties in CO2_PRICE and
INVESTMENT_COST are considered. a method that integrates the backward
DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING ALGORITHM and least_squares MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is
used to solve the model. the results demonstrate that the feed_in tariffs
of 30 PROVINCES_RANGE from 0.68 rmb/kwh to 1.71 rmb/kwh, and the
AVERAGE_LEVEL is 1.01 rmb/kwh. on this basis, we find that the levels of
sub_regional feed_in tariff announced in 2013 are no longer appropriate
and should be adjusted as soon as possible. we have also identified the
implications of TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS and CARBON_EMISSION trading
schemes, as well as the importance of strengthening
ELECTRICITY_TRANSMISSION. it has been suggested that the
CHINESE_GOVERNMENT takes DIVERSE_MEASURES, including increasing RESEARCH
and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENT, establishing and improving a
NATIONWIDE_CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme and accelerating the
construction of electricity_transmission infrastructure, to reduce the
required feed_in tariff and promote the development of
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: evaluating UNCERTAIN_INVESTMENT_DECISIONS in LOW_CARBON_TRANSITION toward
RENEWABLE_ENERGY
Abstract:
```
this paper proposed a model for solving the
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS_AMIDST_UNCERTAINTY in the low_carbon transition
toward RENEWABLE_ENERGY. the REAL_OPTION_METHOD is used and numerous
influencing factors are considered, including the MARKET_PRICE of
ELECTRICITY, FOSSIL_FUEL_COST, CARBON_DIOXIDE_PRICE, INVESTMENT_COST and
long_term changes of feed_in tariff policy associated with
RENEWABLE_ENERGY. the INVESTMENT_DECISIONS related to the transition from
a coal_fired POWER_PLANT to a SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANT in CHINA
have been analyzed in detail. the results indicate the
OPTIMAL_TRANSITION_INVESTMENT_STRATEGY and elucidate the effects of
MULTIPLE_FACTORS on the INVESTMENT_STRATEGY. this provides a
CLEAR_SUGGESTION for both the GOVERNMENT and investor how to
scientifically ADDRESS_UNCERTAINTY and make OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISION
to accelerate the low_carbon transition.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: OPTIMAL_DESIGN of SUBSIDY to stimulate RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS: the
case of CHINA
Abstract:
```
this paper proposes a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for estimating the
OPTIMAL_SUBSIDY for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT by using
STOCHASTIC_PROCESS to describe the MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, co2price
and INVESTMENT_COST. two indicators, i.e., PROJECT_VALUE and
THRESHOLD_VALUE, are used to derive the OPTIMAL_SUBSIDY. the least
SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION_METHOD is used to solve the model. the
proposed model is used to empirically evaluate the OPTIMAL_LEVEL of
SUBSIDY for SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION in CHINA. the results
show that CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme helps reduce SUBSIDY. unit
generating capacity, MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY, co2price and the
VOLATILITY of INVESTMENT_COST are negatively related with SUBSIDY,
WHEREAS_INVESTMENT_COST and the VOLATILITY of ELECTRICITY_PRICE and
co2price are positively related with SUBSIDY. it is suggested that
CHINESE_GOVERNMENTS take some measures, e.g., promoting
TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS, establishing a NATIONWIDE_CARBON_EMISSION trading
MARKET, promoting the COMPETITION in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INDUSTRY as well as
maintaining the stability of co2price and ELECTRICITY_PRICE, to reduce
the required SUBSIDY.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: the VALUATION of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under
CARBON_MARKET_LINKAGE based on REAL_OPTIONS
Abstract:
```
this paper provides a REAL_OPTION_APPROACH to ANALYZE_INVESTMENT_VALUE
for PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under CARBON_MARKET_LINKAGE. the
PRIMARY_PURPOSE is to evaluate PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION under
uncertainties from the perspective of POWER_GENERATION_ENTERPRISES.
uncertainties in INVESTMENT_COSTS, ELECTRICITY_PRICES, CARBON_PRICES and
SUBSIDY_PAYMENTS are considered. in addition, the MARKET co_movements of
INVESTMENT_COSTS are considered in this study. DUNHUANG is taken as a
CASE_STUDY to evaluate the value of PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION through
SCENARIO_ANALYSIS. the RESULT_SHOWS that the INVESTMENT_VALUE of
PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION is negative. enterprise should give up the
INVESTMENT or DELAY_INVESTMENT until MATURE_CONDITIONS. moreover, the
INVESTMENT_VALUE can be improved by TECHNICAL_IMPROVEMENT, increasing a
CERTAIN_RANGE of SUBSIDY_PAYMENTS, etc. the RESEARCH presented would be
useful for PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT_EVALUATION and related
decision_marking.  2016 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: the economic and ENVIRONMENTAL_VALUES of the r&D_INVESTMENT in a
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SECTOR in SOUTH_KOREA
Abstract:
```
although a fossil_based FUEL_ECONOMY has allowed SOUTH_KOREA to rapidly
develop, the ECONOMIC_GROWTH means that SOUTH_KOREA is now one of the
largest sources of CARBON_EMISSIONS. the south KOREAN_GOVERNMENT has
recently made a RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT_PLAN to convert the economy
based on FOSSIL_FUELS to an economy based on RENEWABLE_ENERGY. in order
to analyze the ECONOMIC_FEASIBILITY of the RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT (r&d)
INVESTMENT required for this change, this STUDY_EVALUATES the
r&D_INVESTMENT in the six types of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES  biomass
ENERGY, WASTE_ENERGY, PHOTOVOLTAIC_ENERGY, SOLAR_THERMAL_ENERGY,
MARINE_ENERGY, and WIND POWER_ENERGY, while considering several
UNCERTAINTY_FACTORS  a RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION amount, an
r&D_INVESTMENT amount, a UNIT_PRICE, and a risk_free INTEREST_RATE. this
STUDY_UTILIZES the SYSTEM_DYNAMICS_APPROACH using the black_scholes model
and CONDUCTS_SENSITIVITY_ANALYSES of the UNCERTAINTY_FACTORS. the results
indicate that the RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PRODUCTION amount has a relatively
LARGE_INFLUENCE on both the r&D_INVESTMENT_VALUE and the
CARBON_EMISSION_REDUCTION amount. in the MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION, a
risk_free INTEREST_RATE has annually a SMALL_IMPACT on the
r&D_INVESTMENT_VALUE.  2018 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: valuing INVESTMENT_DECISIONS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY_PROJECTS considering
CHANGING_VOLATILITY
Abstract:
```
VOLATILITY is an IMPORTANT_PARAMETER when evaluating INVESTMENTS using
the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD. for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS, the VOLATILITY
of CASH_FLOW continuously changes, because as NEW_INFORMATION and
knowledge are gathered, there is less FORESEEN_VARIATION. this paper
proposes an extended recombining TRINOMIAL_TREE_MODEL, where the
CHANGING_VOLATILITY is used to GENERATE_TRANSITION_PROBABILITIES. the
CHANGING_VOLATILITY is generated using a CONSOLIDATION_PROCESS where
MULTIPLE_RANDOM_VARIABLES, including the MARKET_PRICE of ELECTRICITY,
CARBON_PRICE, and lending rate, are integrated into a low_dimension
STOCHASTIC_PROCESS. a two_factor LEARNING_CURVE is used to model the
changes of INVESTMENT_COST. we apply the proposed model to
ANALYZE_SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_GENERATION_INVESTMENT in CHINA. the
results show VOLATILITY with changing feature. compared with
CONSTANT_VOLATILITY, CHANGING_VOLATILITY may advance INVESTMENT_DECISIONS
and change the PROJECT_VALUE. COMPLETE_GRID_PARITY_POLICY in the
SOLAR_PV_INDUSTRY is infeasible because the OPPORTUNITY_COST brought by
the option of delaying cannot be offset. the CHANGING_VOLATILITY may
produce a lower and equally EFFECTIVE_SUBSIDY_LEVEL compared with
CONSTANT_VOLATILITY. a CARBON_EMISSION trading scheme is helpful in
advancing INVESTMENTS in RENEWABLE_ENERGY, which is reflected in
improvements in PROJECT_VALUE, advancements in INVESTMENT_DECISIONS, and
reductions in the required SUBSIDY_LEVEL.  2020 elsevier b.v.

Title: the paradox effects of UNCERTAINTY and FLEXIBILITY on INVESTMENT in
RENEWABLES under GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT
Abstract:
```
given that companies have the FLEXIBILITY to decide about size and timing
of a RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY_INVESTMENT, the existence of four paradox
effects is proven: only the type but not the amount of
GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT has an influence on the OPTIMAL_CAPACITY of a
RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY GENERATING_SYSTEM. a decrease of
GOVERNMENTAL_SUPPORT over time may result in higher capacities of
RENEWABLES installed on an INDUSTRY_LEVEL, at least on the SHORT_TERM.
likewise, higher UNCERTAINTY may encourage an expansion of these
capacities. in contrast, TECHNOLOGICAL_PROGRESS may hamper the expansion
of capacities. finally, these four paradox effects are exemplified in a
germany_based CASE_STUDY regarding a PHOTOVOLTAIC_PROJECT.  2016 elsevier

Title: REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES in a
GHG_EMISSIONS trading environment
Abstract:
```
GREEN_HOUSE_GAS (ghg) EMISSIONS have been tied to GLOBAL_CLIMATE change.
governments are seeking ways to help improve performance of their
countries on this ENVIRONMENTAL_ISSUE through introduction of
VARIOUS_POLICY_INSTRUMENTS. one POPULAR_POLICY_INSTRUMENT that seems to
have gained credibility with explicit mention of its application in the
KYOTO_PROTOCOL is the use of permit trading and cap_and_trade MECHANISMS.
VARIOUS_POLITICAL_REGIONS, countries, and even corporations have
introduced, are introducing or seek to introduce this mechanism.
organizations functioning within this environment will need to manage
their resources appropriately to remain competitive. organizations will
either have the opportunity to purchase EMISSIONS_CREDITS (offsets) from
a MARKET trading scheme or seek to reduce their EMISSIONS through
DIFFERENT_MEASURES. some measures may include INVESTMENT in
NEW_TECHNOLOGIES that will reduce their reliance on ghg emitting
practices. in many countries, LARGE_ORGANIZATIONS and
INSTITUTIONS_GENERATE their OWN_POWER to operate their facilities. much
of this power is generated (or bought) from ghg producing TECHNOLOGY.
SPECIFIC_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES such as WIND and
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY may become more FEASIBLE_ALTERNATIVES
available to a LARGE_PERCENTAGE of these organizations if they are able
to take advantage and incorporate the MARKET for GHG_EMISSIONS trading in
their analyses. to help organizations evaluate INVESTMENT in these
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES we introduce a REAL_OPTIONS based model
that will take into CONSIDERATION_UNCERTAINTIES associated with the
TECHNOLOGY and those associated with the ghg trading MARKET. the
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS will consider both the stochastic (UNCERTAINTY)
nature of the exercise price of the TECHNOLOGY and the STOCHASTIC_NATURE
of the MARKET trading price of the GHG_EMISSIONS. managerial and
POLICY_IMPLICATIONS will be discussed.  2008 springer NEW_YORK.

Title: no REAL_OPTION for SOLAR in IRELAND: a REAL_OPTION_VALUATION of
UTILITY_SCALE_SOLAR_INVESTMENT in IRELAND
Abstract:
```
the IRISH_GOVERNMENT recently unveiled plans to have 70% of ELECTRICITY
in the state generated from RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES by 2030. currently
very little ELECTRICITY is generated by SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC in IRELAND. in
this study, a REAL_OPTIONS_FRAMEWORK is applied to assess the
ECONOMIC_FEASIBILITY of utility_scale SOLAR in IRELAND. initially,
ELECTRICITY_PRICES are identified as the MAIN_SOURCE of UNCERTAINTY and
the least SQUARE_MONTE_CARLO_METHOD is used to price the REAL_OPTION. the
findings are that, in the absence of COMPREHENSIVE_POLICY_SUPPORT,
large_scale INVESTMENT in SOLAR in IRELAND is not commercially viable and
that, where the REAL_OPTION has value, the OPTIMAL_STRATEGY is to
DEFER_INVESTMENT. SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS_SHOWS that the results are robust
and the analysis allows investors to make an informed bid to the newly
introduced RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY_SUPPORT_SCHEME (ress). when
POLICY_SUPPORT is introduced, a LARGE_REAL_OPTION_VALUE is obtained, and
UTILITY_SCALE_SOLAR_INVESTMENT is profitable. the implications are that
solar_specific policy supports may work better than policies that include
all RENEWABLE_TECHNOLOGIES because the dominance of onshore WIND_ENERGY
in IRELAND may price other RENEWABLE_SOURCES out.  2021

Title: ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY or CARBON_TRADING SUBSIDY: which is more
efficient to develop PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION from a
GOVERNMENT_PERSPECTIVE?
Abstract:
```
PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_GENERATION has HIGH_INVESTMENT_COSTS and
LONG_PAYBACK_PERIODS. therefore, during EARLY_DEPLOYMENT, subsidies are
fundamental and necessary to accelerate its development. we consider the
question of how to promote PV_INDUSTRY_DEVELOPMENT and which supporting
policy is more efficient in accelerating adoption. based on
REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD, we establish a SUBSIDY_EFFICIENCY_MODEL for
ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES and carbon_trading subsidies under two
sources of UNCERTAINTY_POWER_DEMAND for PV and the INVESTMENT
cost_reduction PROBABILITY. this STUDY_AIMS to compare the two forms of
subsidies from the perspective of promoting IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT and
maximizing the SUBSIDY_POLICY_EFFICIENCY for the GOVERNMENT (minimizing
the unit carbon_mitigation COST) and advance RELEVANT_POLICY_PROPOSALS.
an example of CHINA is provided to test the effectiveness of the model
and to illustrate the implications of the solutions. the results show
that a carbon_trading SUBSIDY is better than an ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY
and that it is essential to improve the demand for the power produced by
the PV power_generation projects. lower MARKET_RISK and driving
TECHNOLOGY_PROGRESS are both conducive to improving the
SUBSIDY_EFFICIENCY. this study also provides a MEANINGFUL_REFERENCE for
GOVERNMENTS_WORLDWIDE to FORMULATE_SUBSIDY_PROGRAMS to SUPPORT_PV

Title: an EVALUATION of INVESTMENT in a PV_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT in the

Abstract:
```
this paper presents a POLICY_BENEFIT_MODEL of a PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV)
POWER_GENERATION_PROJECT based on REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS (ROA) and the
two_factor LEARNING_CURVE model. the MAIN_PURPOSE is to examine the
INVESTMENT_BEHAVIOR of developing a PV_PROJECT in the GOBI_DESERT
considering MULTIPLE_UNCERTAIN_FACTORS. we take the ENVIRONMENTAL_COST of
DESERTIFICATION_CONTROL into account for the first time in the
literature. four other UNCERTAIN_FACTORS are THERMAL_POWER_COST,
PV_POWER_GENERATION_COST, CARBON_PRICES, and GOVERNMENT_SUBSIDY. a
BINARY_TREE_METHOD is applied to solve the proposed model, and we obtain
both UNIT_DECISION_VALUE and OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME. our
BASELINE_SCENARIO_ILLUSTRATES that ROA is more effective than net
PRESENT_VALUE (NPV) analysis when dealing with UNCERTAINTY. our
SIMULATION_RESULTS show that the GOVERNMENT could suffer a loss in
accordance with the existing SUBSIDY_POLICY when investing in a
PV_PROJECT. therefore, the SUBSIDY should be gradually reduced. finally,
the influence of the SUBSIDY_POLICY on DECISION_VALUE is discussed, and
an APPROPRIATE_SUBSIDY is determined accordingly.  2018 by the authors.

Title: POLICY_UNCERTAINTIES: what INVESTMENT_CHOICE for SOLAR_PANEL_PRODUCERS?
Abstract:
```
SOLAR_POWER has achieved GREAT_DEVELOPMENT in the last decade, and it
should continue to play a CENTRAL_ROLE in the face of CLIMATE_CHANGE and
SUSTAINABLE_DEVELOPMENT challenges. this PAPER_BUILDS a
REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL that provides a MICROECONOMIC_ANALYTICAL_FRAMEWORK
with the least SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO (lsm) method to assess the
INVESTMENT_CHOICES of a TYPICAL_SOLAR_PANEL_PRODUCER in CHINA facing
trade and domestic supply_ and demand_side POLICY_UNCERTAINTIES. it
builds a BASELINE_SCENARIO and three POLICY_SCENARIOS with decreasing
anti_dumping and countervailing charges, constant feed_in tariff (fit)
level and reduced INVESTMENT_COST. a TYPICAL_PRODUCER will have to make
an INVESTMENT_DECISION on building a NEW_PRODUCTION_LINE in five YEARS
based on a DECISION_IMPACT_ANALYSIS within 20 YEARS. the RESULT_SHOWS an
IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT_DECISION for all scenarios. the producer will have
higher return from INVESTMENT in building a SOLAR_POWER_PLANT with a
constant fit. export is the OPTIMAL_CHOICE in other scenarios where
INVESTMENT_RETURN is lower. after SENSITIVITY_ANALYSIS, the
PAPER_CONCLUDES and can be used as a toolkit for SOLAR_PANEL_PRODUCERS
and a reference for POLICY_MAKERS to evaluate the impact of
POLICY_UNCERTAINTIES.  2018

Title: least SQUARES_MONTE_CARLO SIMULATION based DECISION_MAKING method for
PHOTOVOLTAIC_INVESTMENT in KOREA
Abstract:
```
SOLAR_POWER for CLEAN_ENERGY is an IMPORTANT_ASSET that will drive the
FUTURE of SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION. as interest in
SUSTAINABLE_ENERGY_INCREASES with koreas RENEWABLE_ENERGY_EXPANSION_PLAN,
a strategy for PHOTOVOLTAIC_INVESTMENT (PV) is important from an
investors point of view. PREVIOUS_RESEARCH primarily focused on assessing
and analyzing the impact of the VOLATILITY but paid little attention to
the MODELING decision_making project to obtain the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING. this PAPER_UTILIZES a least SQUARES_MONTE
carlo_based method for determining the timing of PV_PLANT_INVESTMENT. the
proposed PV decision_making method is designed to simulate the
TOTAL_PV_GENERATION_REVENUE_PERIOD with all UNCERTAIN_PV_PRICE_FACTORS
handled before determining the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME. the
NUMERICAL_STUDIES with nine DIFFERENT_SCENARIOS considering system
MARGINAL_PRICE (smp) and RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATE (rec)
SPOT_MARKET_PRICE in KOREA demonstrated how to determine the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIME for DIFFERENT_PV_CAPACITIES. therefore, the
proposed method can be used as a decision_making tool to provide
PV_INVESTORS with information on the best time to invest in the
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_MARKET.  2021 by the authors. LICENSEE_MDPI, basel,

Title: outdoor monitoring of the ENERGY_YIELD and ELECTRICAL_PARAMETERS of
STANDARD_POLYSILICON based and new UMG_SI PV modules
Abstract:
```
SOLAR_CELLS made of SILICON based on upgraded METALLURGICAL_ROUTES
(umg_si) are becoming a REAL_OPTION to the standard polysilicon_based
multicrystalline (mc_si) devices. a lot of RESEARCH at wafer and
CELL_LEVEL has been carried out so far. however, there is little
experience in REAL_OPERATION_CONDITIONS of PV modules based_on umg_si
feedstock and few of these studies have been published up to present.
this work presents a COMPARATIVE_STUDY between typical mc_si and umg_si
modules, manufactured following exactly the same wafer_to_module
procedure and evaluated in REAL_OUTDOOR_CONDITIONS. the results after
eight months of exposition to OUTDOOR_CONDITIONS show a very close
ENERGY_PRODUCTION for both types of modules. due to their lower COST and
SIMILAR_PERFORMANCE, modules made from UMG_SILICON_FEEDSTOCK are a more
ECONOMIC_OPTION and could play an IMPORTANT_PART in the
PHOTOVOLTAIC_MARKET.  2010 published by ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: COST effective DESIGN of RINGWALL_STORAGE_HYBRID_POWER_PLANTS: a
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS
Abstract:
```
we study the ECONOMIC_VIABILITY and optimal sizing and siting of a
HYBRID_PLANT that combines a RINGWALL_HYDRO_STORAGE_SYSTEM with WIND and
SOLAR_POWER_PLANTS (RINGWALL_STORAGE_HYBRID_POWER_PLANT, rshpp). a
REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL is introduced to analyze the ECONOMICS of an
ONSHORE_RSHPP, an in particular of the varying STORAGE_VOLUME in light of
the STOCHASTIC_CHARACTER of WIND and SOLAR_POWER, as well as the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_TIMING under UNCERTAINTY. in fact, many uncertainties
arise in such a project. ENERGY_PRODUCTION is determined by the
STOCHASTIC_CHARACTER of WIND and SOLAR_POWER, and affects the
OPTIMAL_SIZE of the STORAGE_DEVICE. MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION is performed
to analyze the following sources of UNCERTAINTY: (i) WIND intensity and
SOLAR_IRRADIATION; (ii) FUTURE_ELECTRICITY_PRICE; and (iii)
INVESTMENT_COSTS. the RESULTS_YIELD the OPTIMAL_SIZE of the
STORAGE_DEVICE; the ENERGY_MARKET on which the operator should sell the
ELECTRICITY generated; NUMERICAL_EXAMPLES for two
DIFFERENT_RSHPP_APPLICATION_SCENARIOS; and a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for
analyzing the opportunity to defer the PROJECT_INVESTMENT and thus to
exploit the value of waiting.  2014 published by ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS_INVESTMENT_RISK_ANALYSIS in
GUIZHOU_PROVINCE, CHINA
Abstract:
```
in the NEW_ELECTRICITY_MARKET_ENVIRONMENT, PV_PROJECT_INVESTMENT faces
more INVESTMENT_RISKS. in order to guarantee the supply of ELECTRICITY
effectively and reduce CARBON_DIOXIDE_EMISSIONS, it needs the
RELEVANT_GOVERNMENT_DEPARTMENTS to guide investors to invest in
CLEAN_ENERGY_GENERATION_PROJECTS with APPROPRIATE_POLICIES. based on
REAL_OPTIONS_THEORY, this paper develops a INVESTMENT decision_model and
a RISK_ASSESSMENT_FRAMEWORK for PV_POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS in CHINA. in
the case of grid_connected PV_GENERATION_DEMONSTRATION_PROJECT, this
paper carry out INVESTMENT_DECISION_SIMULATION from the UNCERTAINTY of
INVESTMENT_COST. the SIMULATION_RESULTS show that the model can provide
investors an INVESTMENT_REFERENCE. meanwhile, it can be used as
QUANTITATIVE_ANALYSIS_TOOLS for POLICY_MAKERS to make a
REASONABLE_INVESTMENT_POLICY.  2014 ieee.

Title: a quadranomial REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL for EVALUATION of EMISSIONS_TRADING and
TECHNOLOGY
Abstract:
```
GREEN_HOUSE_GAS (ghg) EMISSIONS have been tied to GLOBAL_CLIMATE change.
one POPULAR_POLICY_INSTRUMENT that seems to have gained credibility with
explicit mention of its application in the KYOTO_PROTOCOL is the use of
permit trading and cap_and_trade MECHANISMS. organizations functioning
within this environment will need to manage their resources appropriately
to remain competitive. organizations will either have the opportunity to
purchase EMISSIONS_CREDITS (offsets) from a MARKET trading scheme or seek
to reduce their EMISSIONS through DIFFERENT_MEASURES. some measures may
include INVESTMENT in NEW_TECHNOLOGIES that will reduce their reliance on
ghg emitting practices. in many countries, LARGE_ORGANIZATIONS and
INSTITUTIONS_GENERATE their OWN_POWER to operate their facilities. much
of this power is generated (or bought) from ghg producing TECHNOLOGY.
SPECIFIC_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES such as WIND and
SOLAR_PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY may become more FEASIBLE_ALTERNATIVES
available to a LARGE_PERCENTAGE of these organizations if they are able
to take advantage and incorporate the MARKET for GHG_EMISSIONS trading in
their analyses. to help organizations evaluate INVESTMENT in these
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES we introduce a REAL_OPTIONS based model
that will take into CONSIDERATION_UNCERTAINTIES associated with the
TECHNOLOGY and those associated with the ghg trading MARKET. the
REAL_OPTIONS_ANALYSIS will consider both the stochastic (UNCERTAINTY)
nature of the exercise price of the TECHNOLOGY and the STOCHASTIC_NATURE
of the MARKET trading price of the GHG_EMISSIONS.
