Title: OPTIMAL_SUBSIDY_ESTIMATION_METHOD using SYSTEM_DYNAMICS and the
REAL_OPTION_MODEL: PHOTOVOLTAIC_TECHNOLOGY_CASE
Abstract:
```
in this paper, we propose a method of optimizing FINANCIAL_SUBSIDIES and
PUBLIC_RESEARCH and DEVELOPMENT_INVESTMENTS for
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_TECHNOLOGIES, rather than optimizing FINANCIAL_SUBSIDY
alone. by combining SYSTEM_DYNAMICS with REAL_OPTION_MODELS, we capture
DYNAMIC_COMPLEX_INTERACTIONS among investors, consumers, and
policymakers, as well as FUTURE_UNCERTAINTIES of KEY_ENERGY, economic,
and ENVIRONMENTAL_FACTORS. our method thereby makes SUBSIDY_OPTIMIZATION
more accurate and flexible. to evaluate our model, we apply it to the
KOREAN_PHOTOVOLTAIC_SUBSIDY and determine that the GOVERNMENT can achieve
the PHOTOVOLTAIC_DIFFUSION_TARGET, even if it reduces the TOTAL_SUBSIDY
by $us 359.5. million. the OPTIMAL_APPROACH is to increase
RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT FUNDING by $us 310.4. million while reducing the
FINANCIAL_SUBSIDY by $us 669.9. million. our method helps
POLICYMAKERS_OPTIMIZE their SUBSIDY_ALLOCATION and therefore
REDUCES_SUBSIDY_INEFFICIENCIES.  2015 ELSEVIER_LTD.

Title: OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIO_STRATEGIES for POWER_ENTERPRISES under multi
POLICY_SCENARIOS of RENEWABLE_ENERGY
Abstract:
```
planning a portfolio that includes
DIFFERENT_POWER_GENERATION_TECHNOLOGIES is an IMPORTANT_METHOD to ensure
expected value and to reduce RISKS for the PROJECT_INVESTMENT of
electric_power enterprises. this PAPER_EVALUATES the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIO_STRATEGIES implemented by
ELECTRIC_POWER_ENTERPRISES by using REAL_OPTION and
PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_METHODS. the REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD is used to
GENERATE_INVESTMENT_VALUES and their distribution. these serve as the
INPUT_VARIABLES of the PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_MODEL. the
PORTFOLIO_OPTIMIZATION_MODEL is built based on the CONDITIONAL_VALUE at
RISK. the OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT is analyzed by considering four
POLICY_SCENARIOS: different expected INVESTMENT_VALUES, the phase_out of
subsidies, tightened CARBON_REDUCTION_STANDARDS, and
DIFFERENT_INITIAL_RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATE_PRICES. a CASE_STUDY is
conducted to analyze the INVESTMENT_DECISION of an
ELECTRIC_POWER_ENTERPRISE in CHINA. the results show the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_PORTFOLIO_STRATEGY, the INVESTMENT_VALUE, and the
CONDITIONAL_VALUE at RISK. the OPTIMAL_DECISION for ensuring a relatively
high expected value while reducing RISKS is to increase the share of
SOLAR_PV_POWER_GENERATION and WIND POWER_GENERATION in
CURRENT_CONDITIONS. tightened CARBON_REDUCTION_STANDARDS and higher
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CERTIFICATES_PRICES are conductive to increase the
INVESTMENT_VALUE, reduce the RISK of loss and increase the share of
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_POWER_GENERATION. in contrast, the phase_out of the
subsidies had the OPPOSITE_EFFECT. the methodology and results can
provide a reference for investors to guide the formulation of the
OPTIMAL_INVESTMENT_DECISION and for the GOVERNMENT to optimize the
POLICY_EFFECT.  2021 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: distributed SOLAR RENEWABLE_GENERATION: OPTION_CONTRACTS with
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CREDIT_UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
SOLAR_ENERGY is rapidly emerging thanks to the decreasing
INSTALLATION_COST of SOLAR_PANELS and the RENEWABLE_PORTFOLIO standard
imposed by STATE_GOVERNMENTS, which gave birth to the
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_CREDIT (rec) and the ALTERNATIVE_COMPLIANCE_PAYMENT
(acp). to make profits from the REC_MARKET in addition to reduced
ENERGY_COSTS, more and more home and BUSINESS_OWNERS choose to
INSTALL_SOLAR_PANELS. recently, third_party FINANCING has become a
COMMON_PRACTICE in SOLAR_PANEL_INVESTMENTS. we discuss OPTIMAL_TIMING for
the host to potentially buy back the SOLAR_PANELS after being installed
for a period of time and how to incorporate the OPTIMAL_TIMING into a
POWER_PURCHASE_AGREEMENT between the host and the third_party developer.
because the REC_PRICE is a MAJOR_SOURCE of UNCERTAINTY and also due to
the acp capping the REC_PRICE, we first propose a REC_PRICE forecasting
model that specifically considers the ACP_VALUES. then by a modified
REAL_OPTION_STRUCTURE, we model the BUYBACK_CONTRACT as a REAL_OPTION and
solve it with an approximate DYNAMIC_PROGRAM based
MONTE_CARLO_SIMULATION_METHOD. we find that as the ACP_VALUE_INCREASES,
the value of the BUYBACK_OPTION also increases under OPTIMAL_TIMING. the
method used does not only apply to SOLAR_PROJECTS but also to other
distributed RENEWABLE_PROJECTS that are third_party financed, such as
WIND generations.  2015 elsevier b.v.

Title: a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to RENEWABLE_ELECTRICITY_GENERATION in the
PHILIPPINES
Abstract:
```
background: the PHILIPPINES is making a SIGNIFICANT_STRIDE to become
ENERGY independent by developing more SUSTAINABLE_SOURCES of ENERGY.
however, INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY is challenged by
COMPETITIVE_OIL_PRICES, very HIGH_INVESTMENT_COST for RENEWABLE_ENERGY,
and HIGH_LOCAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICES. this PAPER_EVALUATES the
attractiveness of investing in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES over continue
using oil for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION. methods: this PAPER_USES the
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH to analyze how the timing of INVESTMENT in
RENEWABLE_ENERGY depends on VOLATILITY of DIESEL_PRICE,
ELECTRICITY_PRICE, and externality for using oil. results: the result
presents a POSITIVE_NET PRESENT_VALUE for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENT.
under UNCERTAINTY in OIL_PRICES, DYNAMIC_OPTIMIZATION describes how
waiting or delaying INVESTMENT in RENEWABLES_INCURS loses. decreasing the
LOCAL_ELECTRICITY_PRICE and incorporating
NEGATIVE_EXTERNALITY_FAVOR_INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY over continuing
the use of oil for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION. conclusions:
REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH_HIGHLIGHTS the FLEXIBILITY in the timing of making
INVESTMENT_DECISIONS. at the CURRENT_ENERGY_REGIME in the PHILIPPINES,
substituting RENEWABLE_ENERGY is a better option than continue importing
oil for ELECTRICITY_GENERATION. policies should aim at supporting
INVESTMENT in more SUSTAINABLE_SOURCES of ENERGY by imposing externality
for using oil or decreasing the price of ELECTRICITY.  2018, the

Title: using REAL_OPTIONS to VALUE_CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and
INVESTMENT_EXPENDITURES in RENEWABLE_ENERGIES in INDIA
Abstract:
```
we calculate the OVERALL_POLICY_VALUE of installed CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and
INVESTMENT_EXPENDITURES in WIND and SOLAR_ENERGIES in INDIA.
RECENT_INCREASES in CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and INVESTMENTS by both the public
and PRIVATE_SECTORS along with GOVERNMENT_SUPPORT_SCHEMES have made these
energies more competitive with traditional FUELS like COAL in generating
ELECTRICITY. we use a two_factor LEARNING_CURVE to model the decline in
prices of WIND and SOLAR_ENERGIES. employing a REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH with
GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES as the STOCHASTIC_VARIABLE we find the OVERALL_VALUE
of PROMOTION_POLICIES in RENEWABLES to be sufficiently large. the
TRIGGER_PRICE of COAL for INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGIES today for
ELECTRICITY_GENERATION suggest early to IMMEDIATE_DEPLOYMENT of
ADDITIONAL_WIND and SOLAR_TECHNOLOGIES as the OPTIMAL_POLICY. with the
option to deploy for a longer TIME_HORIZON, continuing with
PROMOTION_POLICIES of CAPACITY_ADDITIONS and INVESTMENT_EXPENDITURES in
RENEWABLES is more valuable at HIGH_GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES.  2020

Title: VALUATION of defer and RELOCATION_OPTIONS in
PHOTOVOLTAIC_GENERATION_INVESTMENTS by a STOCHASTIC_SIMULATION based
method
Abstract:
```
RISK_MANAGEMENT is crucial when committing INVESTMENTS in
ELECTRICITY_MARKETS. INVESTMENT_PROJECTS for the generation of
ELECTRICITY are capital_intensive, in LARGE_PART_IRREVERSIBLE and
FUTURE_PERFORMANCE is subject to HIGH_UNCERTAINTY. fortunately, most
POWER_GENERATION_PROJECTS have STRATEGIC_FLEXIBILITY for handling
UNCERTAINTY and for mitigating RISKS under UNFAVORABLE_SCENARIOS. modern
corporate FINANCE recognizes REAL_OPTION_ANALYSIS (ROA) as the
CORRECT_WAY to VALUE_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS with these characteristics. due
to both, ENVIRONMENTAL_CONCERNS and escalation of FUEL_PRICES,
ELECTRICITY_GENERATION from RENEWABLE_SOURCES has grown dramatically
worldwide over the last decade. RENEWABLE_INVESTMENT_PROJECTS share many
of the features mentioned. as such, OPTION_VALUATION_METHODS should be
applied to estimate the MONETARY_VALUE of FLEXIBILITY in
RENEWABLE_ENERGY_INVESTMENTS. this work presents an
APPROPRIATE_METHODOLOGY for assessing the ECONOMIC_VALUE of a
PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_PLANT under uncertainties. ROA is applied to determine
the value of delaying the INVESTMENT_DECISION while waiting for better
MARKET_INFORMATION that would reduce ACQUISITION_COSTS due to progress in
SOLAR_TECHNOLOGY. the FLEXIBILITY of relocating the SOLAR_FACILITY in the
FUTURE upon the appearance of a more ATTRACTIVE_SITE in terms of COST,
NETWORK_ACCESSIBILITY or REGULATORY_POLICIES is also valued. the problem
of OPTION_VALUATION is solved through STOCHASTIC_SIMULATION combined with
RECURSIVE_APPROXIMATE DYNAMIC_PROGRAMMING techniques. the methodology
developed might be used by investors for more efficient decision_making
and by REGULATORY_AGENCIES for designing ADEQUATE_SUPPORT_POLICIES that
encourage INVESTMENT in RENEWABLE_ENERGY_GENERATION.  2019 ELSEVIER_LTD

Title: ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY or CARBON_TRADING SUBSIDY: which is more
efficient to develop PHOTOVOLTAIC_POWER_GENERATION from a
GOVERNMENT_PERSPECTIVE?
Abstract:
```
PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) POWER_GENERATION has HIGH_INVESTMENT_COSTS and
LONG_PAYBACK_PERIODS. therefore, during EARLY_DEPLOYMENT, subsidies are
fundamental and necessary to accelerate its development. we consider the
question of how to promote PV_INDUSTRY_DEVELOPMENT and which supporting
policy is more efficient in accelerating adoption. based on
REAL_OPTIONS_METHOD, we establish a SUBSIDY_EFFICIENCY_MODEL for
ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDIES and carbon_trading subsidies under two
sources of UNCERTAINTY_POWER_DEMAND for PV and the INVESTMENT
cost_reduction PROBABILITY. this STUDY_AIMS to compare the two forms of
subsidies from the perspective of promoting IMMEDIATE_INVESTMENT and
maximizing the SUBSIDY_POLICY_EFFICIENCY for the GOVERNMENT (minimizing
the unit carbon_mitigation COST) and advance RELEVANT_POLICY_PROPOSALS.
an example of CHINA is provided to test the effectiveness of the model
and to illustrate the implications of the solutions. the results show
that a carbon_trading SUBSIDY is better than an ELECTRICITY_PRICE_SUBSIDY
and that it is essential to improve the demand for the power produced by
the PV power_generation projects. lower MARKET_RISK and driving
TECHNOLOGY_PROGRESS are both conducive to improving the
SUBSIDY_EFFICIENCY. this study also provides a MEANINGFUL_REFERENCE for
GOVERNMENTS_WORLDWIDE to FORMULATE_SUBSIDY_PROGRAMS to SUPPORT_PV
power_generation projects.  2017, springer science+business media b.v.

Title: ENERGY_EXCHANGE among HETEROGENEOUS_PROSUMERS under PRICE_UNCERTAINTY
Abstract:
```
in this paper, we provide a REAL_OPTIONS_MODEL framing
PROSUMERS_INVESTMENT in PHOTOVOLTAIC_PLANTS. this is presented in a
SMART_GRID_CONTEXT where the EXCHANGE_OF_ENERGY among prosumers is
possible. we determine the OPTIMAL_SIZE of the PHOTOVOLTAIC_INSTALLATIONS
based on the influence the self_consumption profiles on the
EXCHANGE_OF_ENERGY among prosumers. we calibrate the model using figures
relative to the northern ITALY ENERGY_MARKET and investigate the
INVESTMENT_DECISION allowing for DIFFERENT_PROSUMER_PROFILES and consider
several combinations of their INDIVIDUAL_ENERGY_DEMAND and supply. our
findings show that the shape of INDIVIDUAL_ENERGY_DEMAND and supply
curves is crucial to the EXCHANGE_OF_ENERGY among prosumers, and that
there could be circumstances under which no EXCHANGE_OCCURS.  2021

Title: evaluating INDIAS_ENERGY_TARGETS using REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH
Abstract:
```
purpose: the AUTHORS_FORMULATE_INDIAS_ENERGY_TARGETS in light of pushing
for RENEWABLE_ENERGY_SOURCES and reducing the dependence on imported
COAL. share of imported COAL in ELECTRICITY_GENERATION has been
approximately 10 per cent in RECENT_YEARS. while INVESTMENTS in
RENEWABLES have grown in RECENT_YEARS as seen in INSTALLED_CAPACITIES,
coal_fired ELECTRICITY_GENERATION has grown because of rising demand for
ELECTRICITY. the purpose of this study is to find a PLANNER_SOLUTION when
HIGH_GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES_FORCE greater INVESTMENTS in RENEWABLE_ENERGIES.
DESIGN/methodology/approach: the authors use REAL_OPTIONS_APPROACH where
GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES are the STOCHASTIC_VARIABLE. they present an
OPTIMAL_STOPPING_PROBLEM and solving the PROBLEM_BACKWARD, the revenues
from continuing with the CURRENT_ENERGY_GENERATION_MIX and those from
replacing imported COAL with WIND_AND_SOLAR is compared for each period.
findings: the TRIGGER_PRICE for GLOBAL_COAL_PRICES when it is optimal for
the SOCIAL_PLANNER to invest in ADDITIONAL_WIND and SOLAR_CAPACITIES is
found. TRIGGER_PRICES is the threshold when INVESTMENT must be undertaken
whatever be the FUTURE_EVOLUTION of COAL_PRICES; this gives the problem a
value of waiting. INDIA cannot afford to wait to invest if faced with
strict short_term goals. originality/value: the WORK_EVALUATES_INDIAS
DOMESTIC_TARGETS and its PARIS_AGREEMENT_GOALS in light of using more of
WIND and sun and replacing imported COAL. VARIOUS_DATA_SOURCES
(GOVERNMENT_REPORTS, RESEARCH_ARTICLES) are consulted to predict shares
of ELECTRICITY from VARIOUS_SOURCES in FUTURE and the authors find the
OPERATING_COSTS and the INVESTMENT_COSTS associated with switching to
RENEWABLES.  2020, emerald publishing limited.
